the constitutional assembly  deputy presidents minister and deputy minister  provincial premiers  chief justice  president of the constitutional court  leaders of our security services  directorsgeneral and leaders of the public service  honourable members of parliament  distinguished guests  ladies and gentlemen   today in the streets of johannesburg the new patriotism of our new democracy once again asserts itself as citizens of that city express their appreciation for the feat of our soccer team in the african nations cup', 'this is bound to replay itself in other cities adding to the crowning glory of our rugby world champions', 'our sportspersons are performing beyond the nations wildest expectations', 'on and off the field they are uniting our nation like never before by their determination to do the best for their country', 'such is the true character of south africans', 'we do possess the inner strength to achieve excellence', 'we have the will to persevere against all odds', 'we enter  as cabinet and the rest of the executive as parliamentarians as workers and managers as professionals traditional leaders security forces students and communities in general faced with the challenge of bringing these positive qualities to beat on every thing we do to make south africa a winning nation', 'we must bring out the best in all of us  and like our sportspersons perform better everywhere  to expand the economy and create jobs   to improve the quality of life for all   to expand the frontiers of freedom  and  to ensure comprehensive security for all citizens', 'these are the critical challenges that we face within and outside these hallowed chambers', 'in october this year we shall pass the halfway mark of the present legislature and its executive', 'the nation and the world will judge us not on whether we mean to do good  but above all on whether we have mobilised south africans to work together to improve their quality of life', 'indeed madame speaker we can say with confidence that steadily but surely the great majority of south africans do feel that things are improving for the better', 'we are on our way south africa is on its way to a better future', 'life has started to have real meaning for the hundreds of thousands who now have access to clean and safe drinking water', 'the benefits of democracy have a tangible impact for the  homes which have been supplied with electricity during the course of last year', 'to the millions of children who benefit from the school nutrition scheme free medical care and free and compulsory education not only has the present become better  there is also great confidence in the future', 'this is the case with communities where the clinicbuilding programme and the district health system are taking root  the workers in public works programmes  the communities who can at least feel secure on a piece of land they can call their own  and the families who for the first time are benefiting from the farmer support programme and extension of agricultural credit', 'at last millions who had no hope in the future can look ahead with confidence in the full knowledge that they have a government prepared to work together with them to build a better life for all', 'we formally start the third session of the democratic parliament with south africas economy healthier than in many decades', 'the rekindling of business confidence and optimism reflect the solid foundation on which the economic upswing is based', 'the expansion of the manufacturing sector phenomenal growth in fixed investments and large capital inflows hold out a promise for a durable recovery and the potential for an even better performance', 'we enter  with no hesitation about the extent to which democracy has taken root in our society', 'the confidence of the population in the democratic process was again shown during the local government elections', 'at the same time the institutions charged with safeguarding constitutional freedoms such as the human rights commission the land commission and the office of the public protector have been formed', 'the constitutional court has in its one year of existence firmly asserted itself as an independent impartial and authorita tive guardian of the constitution', 'in brief south african politics is ascending to the level of normalcy where civilised standards of political relations will be entrenched unmediated by antagonistic conflict or administrative interventions', 'the progress we have made across the board is a result in great measure of the intervention of honourable members gathered here and the provincial legislators in setting the parameters and direction of transformation  in your devoted the citizenry', 'performance of these elected institutions', 'our legislatures are in the first instance the custodians of the new system and secondly the bodies through which the programme of reconstruction and development nationbuilding and reconciliation can and should be codified and turned into a living reality', 'yes south africa is not only on the right road', 'we are well on our way to making this the country of our dreams', 'i take the opportunity to congratulate all south africans in the public and private sectors the most prominent in the land as well as the humble member of the community all of whom are striving to add another brick to the edifice of our democracy', 'we have set out on this road together and we should together aim for the stars', 'madame speaker   if these achievements are something to be proud of this is because they have laid the foundation to make a real impact on the inequities of the past', 'for we are only at the beginning of a long journey a journey we should undertake with expedition if our con sciences are not impervious to the cries of desperation of millions', 'but this is a journey too that requires thorough planning and tenacious industry if we are to remain on course and capable of sustaining our march', 'let me preface the identification of the challenges of the coming year by saying that all of us all south africans are called upon to become builders and healers', 'but for all the joy and excitement of creation to build and to heal are difficult undertakings', 'we can neither heal nor build if such healing and building are perceived as oneway process with the victims of past injustices forgiving and the beneficiaries merely content in gratitude', 'together we must set out to correct the defects of the past', 'we can neither heal nor build if on the one hand the rich in our society see the poor as hordes of irritants  or if on the other hand the poor sit back expecting charity', 'all of us must take responsibility for the upliftment of our conditions prepared to give our best to the benefit of all', 'we can neither heal nor build if we continue to have people in positions of influence and power who at best pay lip service to affirmative action black empowerment and the emancipation of women or who are in reality opposed to these goals  if we have people who continue with blind arrogance to practice racism in the workplaces and schools despite the appeal we made in our very first address to this parliament', 'we must work together to ensure the equitable distribution of wealth opportunity and power in our society', 'we cannot build or heal our nation if in both the private and public sectors in the schools and universities in the hospi tals and on the land in dealing with crime and social dislocation if we continue with business as usual wallowing in notions of the past', 'everywhere and in everything we do what is now required is boldness in thinking firmness in resolve and consistency in action', 'the message i am trying to convey is that all of us must take the national project of accelerated and fundamental transformation of our country very seriously indeed', 'the achievement of the objectives of equity nonracialism and nonsexism constitute the very essence of the new society we seek to build', 'in the history of nations generations have made their mark through their acumen to appreciate critical turning points and with determination and creativity to seize the moment', 'south africa is well on its way to a new and better life', 'this we will achieve only if we shed the temptation to proceed casually along th road  only if we fully take the opportunities that beckon', 'we must unite in a new patriotism to achieve the goal of creating a new society', 'madame speaker   the potential for economic growth and development are better than in many decades', 'but let us be brutally frank', 'despite the welcome rate of growth very few jobs have been created', 'in fact against the backdrop of new entrants into the job market there has been a shrinkage in opportunities', 'we need a national vision to lift us out of this quagmire', 'if we do not act together in the public and private sectors to develop and implement such a national strategic vision the danger is that even the modest growth we have attained will peter out in a matter of a few years as the strain of limited capacity skills shortage balance of payments and other constraints start to gather momentum  and as increasing unemployment and accelerating poverty bear down on our society', 'to move forward with purpose requires that we extricate the public and private sectors from the current comfort zones and break through the threshold to achieve a rate of growth sufficient to create jobs and generate resources for rapid socioeconomic programmes to uplift the poor', 'for purposes of emphasis let me identify three important investment challenges and attendant difficult choices that have to be made', 'firstly we require major investment in infrastructure including such areas as municipal services housing and construction and telecommunications in order to create jobs at the same time as we improve services to the citizenry', 'as we enter these areas in a decisive manner the question will arise over and over again whether we can attain our objective if the profit motive is the only dynamo of our actions  secondly we need investment and restructuring of manufacturing and other industries such as tourism agriculture and mining which are critical for export and foreign exchange earnings', 'related to this for instance is the challenge whether we can continue with the same structure of our agricultural industry given our capricious climatic conditions  thirdly none of the economic objectives we aspire to can be realised without massive investment in people', 'i refer here to questions of skills development adult education and the overhaul of our entire education system as well as health and other services which i will return to later', 'indeed as we struggle to widen the skills base and to absorb more people into the economy the challenge will continue to face organised labour and the employed in general including the managers can we succeed if we premise our actions narrowly on the interests of those who are already economically engaged  when all is said and done we return again to the challenge of a new south african patriotism that at the end of each day everyone of us should afford a smile in his or her face when we pose to ourselves the question what have i done today to create jobs and improve my skills and those of others  as government we fully acknowledge the critical role that we need to play in realising the vision of growth and development', 'i wish to emphasise that over the past year government has moved to a new level of coordination that is unprecedented in the history of our country', 'it is quite clear to us that success in achieving the growth and development objectives we have identified requires integration of planning and operations across departments and provinces', 'important crosssectoral meetings and intergovern mental forums are being held to elaborate the growth and development strategy and the institutional mechanisms required to drive it', 'i should personally make the observation that we are finally succeeding in galvanising government to give effective leadership to economic growth and development', 'within weeks we should be able to make major announcements on the progress made', 'in order to improve the investment climate our monetary authorities are reviewing on an ongoing basis the timing and pace of lifting existing exchange controls', 'for us it is not a matter of whether but of when these controls will be phased out', 'it is critical if we have to promote competitiveness export and the creation of jobs that we should have in place the necessary supplyside measures', 'already consensus is being reached in nedlac about the required incentives that will help boost training pro ductivity work organisation and investment in particular industries and regions', 'arguably the most important measures in this regard pertain to the development of small and mediumsized businesses', 'relevant legislation on these issues as well as the critical question of competitive practices in the economy should come before parliament during the course of this session', 'i am convinced that the various roleplayers in the economy have long passed questioning the need or otherwise for such competitive practices and the longterm benefits this will bring to the economy including big and small companies', 'i hope too that legislation on employment equity and standards will be passed in this session with the support of all relevant stakeholders', 'this should also be the case with the restructuring of public assets in order to use them to accelerate growth and development attune them with modern levels of technology reorganise them to expand services to all citizens and reshape them in line with the imperatives of internal democracy', 'it was to be expected that such a massive undertaking should generate much debate among the public and the working class in particular', 'what is clear though is that there was a breakdown of communication which precipitated unnecessary acrimony on an issue that should enjoy the support of all interested parties', 'i am happy that the national framework agreement negotiated between government and the trade unions was adopted by cabinet two days ago', 'therefore the governments relationship with labour from the level of the executive as a whole to the departments and the management of public enterprises must be set on a viable footing to ensure cooperative rather than confrontational interaction', 'we are confident that the restructuring programme will be carried out with due speed  and carried out in a manner that involves and benefits all stakeholders', 'madame speaker and honourable members   it is the firm view of the government of national unity that the growth and development strategy should be pursued in an integrated manner', 'we do not subscribe to the notion that growth on its own can rectify the backlogs of apartheid in a mysterious trickledown fashion', 'in any case in our skewed social structure there cannot be growth without development', 'areas of development that protect and improve our human resources', 'four important areas identify themselves for special mention', 'the first area is education', 'on this the th anniversary of the students uprising and the oaudeclared year of education in africa we face the stark reality that south africa lags behind many african countries in so far as literacy and other human development indicators are concerned', 'we owe it to that corps of brave young people who rose up against the apartheid system to institute further measures this year decisively to move towards a nonracial democratic and equitable education system', 'if anything the matric results last year and the reality of children in the northern province and elsewhere whose classes have to scatter in disarray at the first signs of rain are a stark reminder of how far we still are from that goal', 'clearly rectifying these imbalances will require redistribution of the limited resources among races and provinces', 'it will also require even greater commitment to teach and to learn from teachers and students alike', 'and i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate them as well as the parents for the stability that has set in in our institutions of learning', 'two days ago cabinet adopted the white paper on education', 'the centrepiece of such restructuring should be the establishment of a qualitydriven public school system available to all south african children', 'among other things that should drive this is democratic governance involving parents teachers and students at secondary level a curriculum and careerguidance scheme that are more appropriate to the needs of the country and community involvement', 'adult basic education and early  at university and technikon levels it is necessary that the debate on transformation starts in earnest in an organised manner so that policy positions can emerge to guide these autonomous institutions', 'as one measure of our commitment to tackle the backlogs in the building of schools rbillion has been allocated for this purpose', 'a further rmillion has been set aside for a student financing support scheme for universities and technikons', 'the matter of retrenchment of teachers has once again arisen though in a sensational and unfortunate manner', 'today i once more wish to reassure teachers that this government is committed to redeploy rather than retrench teachers', 'any other approach would not make sense given the needs in many parts of the country', 'this process itself will be the subject of extensive consultation and only in extreme cases will the possibility of retrenchment be considered', 'i hope that this year will see cooperation among all parties in these chambers to facilitate educational reform', 'pronouncements about economic growth sound hollow if they are followed up by attempts to block by hook or by crook legislation meant to equip children with the required skills', 'declarations of loyalty to democracy can only be but mere words if in actual practice people are seen to defend islands of white privilege', 'the second important area is health delivery', 'many steps have been taken to introduce a new health policy based principally on greatly expanding the primary health care system', 'the clinicbuild ing programme often seems insignificant by the standards of those who have resources in abundance', 'but in the rural areas and sprawling urban settlements this is a matter literally of life and death', 'it is therefore of great significance that we have moved from the planning stages to actual implementation', 'during the course of last year many ugly incidents took place which brought to the fore the terrible conditions under which health workers operate', 'let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to them for their selfless service to communities', 'while we strongly disapprove of some of these incidents we fully appreciate their plight', 'discussions are at an advanced stage to formulate a new grading system and avail incentives especially in rural areas', 'like with all other professions we value very highly the services of doctors and other health workers  and we shall do our best to ensure their security', 'i should once more emphasise the need for a massive education campaign on the aids epidemic and commend the relevant ministries for the work they are doing in this regard', 'we dare remind our selves that all the objectives we outline here will not be pos sible to attain if the aids epidemic is not brought under control', 'policy and implementation', 'it is a matter of common knowledge  painfully common to those without housing  that many constraints have bedevilled the proper implementation of this programme', 'but the staying power of this democratic government is its preparedness to acknowledge weaknesses and strive to rectify them', 'such is the quality of the minister and staff that they have critically and openly examined these problems and identified corrective measures', 'what is clear from their decisions is that we need not one but many integrated campaigns to deal with the housing problem', 'these include  greater commitment on the part of financial institutions to allocate resources to poor areas  and  firm indications from communities that the rent and service boycotts have in the spirit of masakhane come to an end', 'over and above these issues we cannot over emphasise the centrality particularly of local government in the housing programme the provision of infrastructure and related campaigns', 'we also need to examine the pertinent question of the integration of our cities', 'too many of the lowcost housing initiatives are mere additions to apartheids black townships saddled with the same problems of distance from workplaces and lack of proper community facilities', 'to address this will require a creative approach among others to the question of residential densities which will also help to reduce infrastructural costs including those related to public transport', 'the fourth area pertains to land reform', 'i am certain that all of us welcome the passing of the bill on security of tenure and the launch last week of the green paper on land reform', 'when finalised the policies adopted will form an important part of our rural development strategy', 'for the first time in centuries families turned into insecure sojourners in the land of their birth can talk of real security', 'soon the land claims court will begin its work  and we are confident that it will deal with the complex problems in a manner that ensures justice and promotes the agricultural interests of the country', 'no one has reason to fear the aim of government is to build not to destroy', 'in these four areas of our socioeconomic programmes and others what is required is a partnership among all sectors communities government and the private sector', 'thus when we talk of the new patriotism we are talking also of efforts of communities to build one another and together build their future', 'we are talking of masakhane  madame speaker   the question needs to be posed whether we do indeed have a state machinery capable of meeting the objectives of growth and development  i should start off by thanking all ministers the public service commission and heads of department sincerely for their efforts in this difficult transitional period', 'steadily progress is being registered in making the public service broadly representative of society', 'from a trifle of  today black managers constitute  of this echelon', 'from less than  females now constitute  of management', 'progress yes  but not nearly enough', 'the public service commission has placed on the table a new salary and grading system which contains within it the potential to redress past inequalities stabilise labour relations and promote reform of the service', 'government supports this proposal in principle and discussions are continuing on ways of financing it', 'we are confident that when finalised the white paper and legislation will enjoy the support of workers and managers alike all of whom will have fully participated in their formulation', 'yet all this does not resolve some of the complex and immediate problems arising from the apartheid past', 'let us remind ourselves of this governments mandate which is to establish a single streamlined efficient and transparent public service and to allocate more public resources to capital expenditure', 'let us be frank and say that the current service is too large and it has to be rationalised', 'there is no other option', 'however our actions cannot ignore the painful truth that the most affected will be areas that are poor with low economic activity and little prospect for alternative employment', 'this means among other things searching for creative negotiated solutions that will help stimulate economic activity', 'the rationalisation process will not be vindictive', 'neither will it be carried out in a haphazard manner', 'rather it will affect all races and provinces', 'discussion are well advanced with the relevant ministry to set up the presidential review commission which will redefine the structure functions and procedures of the public service and relevant announcements can be expected soon', 'among the greatest challenges for  is to further build the capacity of government to serve communities', 'nowhere is this needed more than at local level where government interacts on a daily basis with communities', 'it should therefore be the case that one of the main themes of this year will be the introduction of massive training programmes for the newlyelected councillors and their staff', 'local government must be given the necessary capacity not only to handle finances and render efficient and affordable services', 'it is critical that accountability and mobilisation of communities should also form part of their ethos', 'this elected officials at local level should know that in the final analysis nation building and reconciliation economic growth and development will depend largely on the performance of local councils', 'despite predictions to the contrary the people showed their confidence in the new democracy and reaffirmed their mandate to the government of national unite in the november elections', 'our task at all levels is to justify that trust and confidence by mobilising them to work together for an improvement in their conditions of life', 'it is part of that mandate to ensure that there is cooperative governance among all tiers  so that national provincial and local governments complement one another', 'in kwazulunatal and parts of the western cape where local elections will take place in may we expect and should work for campaigns that are free of violence and intimidation campaigns which promote unity in our diversity', 'we hope that all the parties within andoutside this chamber will openly commit themselves to the conduct of free and fair elections', 'honourable members   the national effort to improve the quality of life of the people means also that each citizen and each community should enjoy security in the home at work and in the streets', 'we believe that it has now dawned on all present here that dealing with crime and violence requires a comprehensive strategy and hard work rather than just injunctions from election platforms', 'i am happy to announce that cabinet will soon unveil the national crime prevention strategy for public comment', 'this strategy brings together the combined efforts of the police judiciary and prison authorities in an effective criminal justice system', 'the aim is not only to improve the capacity of police to prevent crime and apprehend criminals  but it is also to ensure that they are dealt with to the full extent of the law and properly rehabilitated', 'we commend the business community for the campaign they have launched against crime and corruption', 'some of the practical steps that they have taken are starting to bear fruit  and the many proposals from their conference will form part of the strategy we have referred to', 'within communities cooperation with the police is improving by the day with positive results', 'no one can doubt the commitment of the south african police service to deal with crime', 'and we pay tribute to them for daily putting their lives in danger in the service of their country', 'great progress has been made in transforming this institution integrating the various services introducing civilian oversight and ensuring professionalism in their operations', 'the dedication with which the leadership of the service has gone about rooting out corruption and taking the war to the syndicates and other criminals should be commended', 'and the abiding lesson from their successes is that this can only be accomplished with the cooperation of communities and individual citizens', 'we should also remind ourselves over and over again that crime constitutes more than just drug trafficking and car hijacking', 'when tons and tons of vegetables disappear without trace in a city council depot this is criminal conduct of the worst order', 'when billions are siphoned off from companies and out of the country this is criminal robbery of the nations resources', 'when food and funds meant for school children are stolen this is criminal plunder against our children and our future', 'a particular feature of crime in our country is the violence afflicting kwazulunatal the taxi industry as well as bizarre incidents of gang warfare and other murders', 'by any name and under any guise this is criminal conduct  and it should be dealt with as such', 'incidents in the kwazulunatal south coast where individuals have organised themselves to undermine physically and otherwise investigations into the murders which took place over the holiday period', 'armed with an assortment of weapons they have taken it upon themselves in full view of the public media to challenge the nations lawenforcement agencies', 'i am today issuing a strong warning to these elements that this cannot be allowed to continue', 'the time has come for our nation to choose whether we want to become a lawgoverned and peaceful society or hapless hostages of lawlessness', 'i have discussed this matter with the ministry and the leadership of the police service and they have assured me that strong action will be taken', 'in addition to this i wish to announce today that preparations are under way to introduce measures that will prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public manifestations', 'no one irrespective of organisations to which they may belong will be exempted from these measures', 'dealing with crime violence and corruption requires a new morality for our new nation', 'indeed it requires a new patriotism among communities the public and private sectors and the security services  so that at the end of each day each one of us can answer in the affirmative the question have i done something today to stamp out crime  the performance of the nation against crime depends heavily on the intelligence capacity of the security services as a whole', 'on this depends also the security of our democracy', 'and i should pay tribute to the unsung heroes in the intelligence community who are contributing immensely to our successes in this regard', 'i also wish to reiterate the governments commitment to protect the rights of privacy and ensure the security of all individuals in public service as well as other citizens', 'this is the code of conduct which guides all our security services', 'however in plying their dubious trade criminals should not hope to hide behind these provisions of our constitution', 'the government will use all lawful means to ensure that they do not succeed in undermining our social fabric', 'lawabiding citizens can rest assured that there are effective mechanisms in place to prevent and punish any rapacious invasion of their lives', 'our security services are committed to follow the rules because they know as much as we all do that anything else is a sure recipe for the decay of our democratic system for a psychosis of fear and a slide into authoritarianism', 'the government including the security services will not allow this to happen', 'tribute also goes to the south african national defence force which has distinguished itself in the integration process in further enhancing its legitimacy in the eyes of our people and the international community and in assisting the police services to deal with crime and violence', 'as should be expected the new political milieu has dictated that we scale down the resources allocated to the defence force', 'this is a difficult and painful process particularly for the citizens in uniform', 'but we wish to assure them that the aim has never been and will never be to undermine this important national resource', 'there is national consensus that our defence force requires an appropriate capacity and modern equipment', 'we welcome the fact that debate on these issues is now finding rational reflection in the discussions around the defence white paper and the national defence review', 'these processes should be completed during the course of this year so that we can achieve certainty and a national policy to which all of us can pay allegiance', 'madam speaker   if during the course of the past year south africa afforded its citizens unprecedented freedom and a human rights culture the frontiers are bound to widen immeasurably in ', 'the new patriotism abroad in our nation is a reflection of how liberating democracy is for all our citizens in their rainbow colours', 'no longer is the state a mighty colossus intimidating everyone in its wake', 'the openness in this and other legislatures the transparency of the executive and the participatory style of government  all these have given practical meaning to the concept of government by the people for the people', 'in addition to the independent institutions such as the constitutional court which i mentioned earlier the truth and reconciliation commission will help cement democracy by laying bare that which our nation should never again experience', 'it will entrench justice by affording victims the reparations due to them', 'it will through this and by means of amnesty ensure lasting reconciliation', 'as with other such institutions the truth and reconciliation commission will succeed only if it gets the cooperation of all of us', 'i call on all south africans to respect the commissions independence and impartiality its integrity and good faith', 'the commissioners themselves have reiterated what the founding legislation pronounces that the aim of their work is justice and reconciliation not vengeance', 'the frontiers of our freedoms are bound to widen this year principally because the permanent basic law of the land will be adopted by the constitutional assembly', 'a few months remain before the deadline set in the interim constitution expires', 'we should burn the midnight oil to meet this deadline  and achieve normal democratic principles accepted everywhere in the world', 'it is also crucial that we attain constitutional certainty both for ourselves and in our relations with the international community', 'many difficult issues need to be resolved', 'questions of democratic majority rule cooperative governance universally accepted human rights and language equity are only some of them', 'as in the past these matters can only be resolved in genuine negotiations in the spirit of give and take', 'the new constitution must be inclusive a basic law of the land to which all sectors of society can pay allegiance', 'it behoves all members and parties in the constitutional assembly to take full part in the work of the assembly and fulfil the mandate of their supporters', 'and in all instances we should be guided by the imperative to make our country a truly nonracial and nonsexist democracy its citizens united by equity in their diversity', 'these are the principles which should also guide us in protecting and advancing members of our society who have suffered undue privations under apartheid women and youth in particular', 'honourable members will agree with me that we cannot allow parliament to rise at the end of this session before legislation on the youth and gender equality commissions is adopted', 'in needs of these sectors these commissions will help mobilise the resources required to implement relevant programmes', 'children senior citizens and the disabled', 'besides the other programmes indicated earlier progress is being made in the cabinet committee which is developing a national programme of action on children', 'and the restructuring of the welfare system in general and as it pertains to the elderly are among the tasks that the relevant departments are expected to accomplish this year', 'we wish to reaffirm this governments commitment to introduce programmes that will ensure that the disabled can realise their full potential', 'as we deepen our democracy and make progress in our trans formation it is to be expected that south africa will be called upon to relate to the international community more as an equal partner rather than a mere beneficiary of solidarity', 'this we should be proud of because it reflects the confidence the world has in the progress we are making towards creating a normal society', 'in addition to hosting important events of the southern african region world conferences on critical socioeconomic questions science and technology as well as sporting tournaments we have started to play an important role in contributing to peace and other efforts of the international community', 'this we shall always do within the limits of our capacity', 'our participation at the th anniversary celebrations of the united nations helped reinforce the voice for the un to restructure itself in line with the demands of the current age', 'we are proud that south africa will this year host the th session of the united nations conference on trade and development and the conference on the information society', 'we should not tire of contributing our fair share to the building of a better world if only because such an outcome is in the best interests of south africa as well', 'however we should always be mindful of the limitations we have as a nation as well as the constraints of the real world we have to deal with', 'we are confident that during the course of this year progress will be made in the negotiations with members of the southern african customs union the european community and other regions for agreements that will benefit ourselves and our partners', 'let us also take this opportunity to reiterate our firm commitment to regional cooperation under the auspices of sadc', 'in our relations with virtually all countries of the world be it in the organisation of african unity and its member states the binational commissions with the united states and russia relations with countries of the indian ocean rim asia and the pacific europe and the americas we have not only come across goodwill but also immense opportunities for our country', 'as to whether we take full advantage of these opportunities depends on all of us both in the public and private sectors', 'we hope that the discussion documents being finalised by the foreign ministry will generate informed public debate about our international relations the better to unite all sectors of our population in advancing the nations interests', 'madame speaker   there is a new patriotism abroad in our land', 'whatever the social stations they occupy no matter how humble  south africans are showing a determination to work together and make our country a winning nation', 'our task is to harness these energies into a material force for growth and development safety and security nationbuilding and reconciliation', 'such are the demands of this historical moment', 'such are the demands of the new south africa', 'i am confident that this session of parliament will measure up to the challenge of the times', 'i thank you']"

devastation of a pandemic that over the past two years has taken the lives of tens of thousands of south africans put two million people out of work and brought misery to families', 'the fire in parliament reminded us of the destruction violence and looting that we witnessed in parts of the country in july last year of the more than  lives lost and many more livelihoods ruined', 'as we reflect on the past year we recall the words of president thabo mbeki who reminded us that trying times need courage and resilience', 'our strength as a people is not tested during the best of times',

presiding officers of parliament and indeed all the members of our two houses that the work of this democratic institution should continue without interruption', 'there are moments in the life of a nation when old certainties are unsettled and new possibilities emerge', 'in these moments there is both the prospect of great progress and the risk of reversal', 'today we are faced with such a

fundamental reforms are needed to revive economic growth', 'there is a need both to address the immediate crisis and to create conditions for longlasting stability and development', 'to achieve this south africa needs a new consensus', 'a consensus that is born out of a common understanding of our current challenging situation and a recognition of the need to address the challenges of unemployment poverty and inequality', 'this should be a new consensus which recognises that the state must create an environment in which the private sector can invest and unleash the dynamism of the economy', 'but equally an environment in which south africans can live a better life and unleash the energy of their capabilities', 'this should also be a new consensus which embraces our shared responsibility to one another and acknowledges that we are all in this together', 'as the social partners  government labour business and communities  we are working to determine the actions we will take together to build such a consensus', 'we have begun discussions on what tradeoffs are needed and what contribution we will each need to make', 'we have given ourselves  days to finalise a

to the divides of race geography and education covid has exacerbated the divide between those who are employed and unemployed', 'last year our unemployment rate reached its highest recorded level',

'when electricity supply cannot be guaranteed when railways and ports are inefficient when innovation is held back by a scarcity of broadband spectrum when water quality deteriorates companies are

electricity generation and the establishment of an independent stateowned transmission company', 'our economy cannot grow without efficient ports and railways', 'over several years the functioning of our ports has declined relative to ports in other parts of the world and on the african continent', 'this constrains economic activity', 'the agricultural sector for example relies heavily on efficient wellrun ports to export their produce to overseas markets', 'fresh produce cannot wait for days and even weeks stuck in a terminal', 'this hurts businesses and compromises our countrys reputation as an exporter of quality fresh produce', 'transnet is addressing these challenges and is currently focused on improving operational efficiencies at the ports through procuring additional

town and the mabopane line in pretoria have been reopened to be followed by the remaining lines in the next year', 'one of the greatest constraints on the technological development of our economy has been the unacceptable delay in the migration of broadcasting from analogue to digital', 'the switchoff of analogue transmission has been completed in a number of provinces', 'as i announced in the sona last year the other provinces will move to digital signal by the end of march ', 'as part of this process government will continue to subsidise lowincome households so that they can access a settop box and make the switch to digital tv', 'our communications regulator icasa will commence with the auctioning of the high frequency communications spectrum in about three weeks from now', 'this will unlock new spectrum for mobile telecommunications for the first time in over a decade', 'in addition we will facilitate the rapid deployment of broadband infrastructure across all municipalities

to review labour market regulations for smaller businesses to enable them to hire more people while continuing to protect workers rights', 'a new redesigned loan guarantee scheme is being introduced

development finance institutions and nonbank sme providers in offering finance expand the types of financing available and adjust eligibility criteria to encourage greater uptake', 'the national treasury is working with industry stakeholders to finalise the scheme and will provide details soon', 'we are reviewing the business act  act  of   alongside a broader review of legislation that affects small medium and smallenterprises smmes  to reduce the regulatory burden on informal businesses', 'there are too many regulations in this country that are unduly complicated costly and difficult to comply with', 'this prevents companies from growing and creating jobs', 'we are therefore working to improve the business environment for companies of all sizes through a dedicated capacity in the presidency to reduce red tape', 'if we are to make progress in cutting unnecessary bureaucratic delays for businesses we need dedicated capacity with the means to make changes', 'i have therefore appointed mr sipho nkosi to head up a team in my office to cut red tape across government', 'mr nkosi has extensive experience in business including as the ceo of exxaro resources and is currently the chairperson of the small business institute', 'the red tape team will identify priority reforms for the year ahead including mechanisms to ensure government departments pay suppliers

and improved technical capabilities we have prioritised infrastructure projects to support economic growth and better livelihoods especially in energy roads and water management', 'the infrastructure fund is at the centre of this effort with a r billion allocation from the fiscus over  years', 'the fund is now working with state entities to prepare a pipeline of projects with an investment value of approximately r billion in student accommodation social housing telecommunications water and sanitation and transport', 'several catalytic projects to the value of r billion are expected to start construction this year', 'of this r', ' billion is contributed by government and the balance from the private sector and developmental finance institutions', 'government will make an initial investment of r', ' billion in bulk infrastructure which will unlock seven private sector projects to the value of r billion', 'for millions of south africans in rural areas roads and bridges provide access to markets employment opportunities and social services', 'yet many children still have to brave overflowing rivers to reach schools and motorists have to battle impassable roads to reach the next town', 'we are therefore upscaling the welisizwe rural bridges programme to deliver  bridges a year from the current ', 'our south african national defence force sandf is the implementing agent of the welisizwe programme and has demonstrated the expertise of sandf engineers in bridge construction', 'earlier this week i was in thakgalane village limpopo to launch a new road that is going to

lindokuhle msomi an unemployed tv producer from kwamashu hostel saved the r grant he received for nine months to start a fast food stall and to support his family', 'as much as it has had a substantial impact we must recognise that we face extreme fiscal constraints', 'a fiscal crisis would hurt the poor worst of all through the deterioration of the basic services on which they rely', 'mindful of the proven benefits of the grant we will extend the r grant for one further year to the end of march ', 'during this time we will engage in broad consultations and detailed technical work to identify the best options to replace this grant', 'any future support must pass the test of affordability and must not come at the expense of basic services or at the risk of unsustainable spending', 'it remains our ambition to establish a minimum level of support for those in greatest need', 'expanding access to land is vital for our efforts to reduce hunger and provide people with meaningful livelihoods', 'we are moving ahead with land reform in terms of the constitution and anticipate the approval of the expropriation bill during this year', 'the establishment of the agriculture and land reform development agency will be finalised this year', 'the department of public works and infrastructure will finalise the transfer of   hectares of state land to the housing

importance of supporting smallscale farmers and integrating them into value chains', 'through the sugar master plan the industry has provided r million to over   smallscale sugar cane growers as part

smallscale farmers this year', 'none of our efforts to revive our economy will succeed if we do not tackle the scourge of corruption once and for all', 'since the beginning of the year i have been provided with the first two parts of the report of the commission of inquiry into state capture headed by acting chief justice raymond zondo', 'while the definitive conclusion has yet to be delivered at the end of this month the first two parts of the report make it plain that there was indeed state capture', 'this means that public institutions and stateowned enterprises soes were infiltrated by a criminal network intent on looting public money for private gain', 'the reports have detailed the devastating effects of this criminal activity on south african airways transnet denel south african revenue service sars and government communications', 'state capture had a direct and very concrete negative impact on the lives of all south africans but especially the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society', 'it has weakened the ability of the state to deliver services and to meet the expectations and constitutional rights of people', 'we must now do everything in our power to ensure that it never happens again', 'my responsibility is to ensure that the commission report is properly and carefully considered and then acted upon', 'by no later than  june i will present a plan of action in response to the commissions recommendations', 'we will as the commissions first report recommends strengthen the system to protect whistleblowers who are a vital safeguard in the fight against corruption and who take huge personal risk in reporting wrongdoing', 'we are doing a detailed review of all applicable legislation and a comparative study of other jurisdictions to strengthen whistleblower protection', 'the relevant law enforcement agencies are taking the necessary steps to address the immediate concern about the safety of whistle blowers', 'many individuals and companies that the commission has found were responsible for state capture must now be held to account', 'i have every confidence that the national prosecuting authority npa will carry out the further investigations that the commission has recommended and that it will bring the members of the criminal network that infiltrated government and captured the state swiftly to justice', 'the investigating directorate in the npa is now poised to deliver on its crucial mandate and a dedicated team has been established to pursue these cases', 'we will be appointing a new head of the investigating directorate following the departure of adv hermione cronje from that position', 'an amendment to the state capture commission regulations in june  empowered the sharing of information between the commission and law enforcement agencies', 'this amendment also permitted the employment of the state capture commission personnel by law enforcement agencies', 'these empowering provisions has geared the investigating directorate to more effectively pursue the investigations emanating from the commission', 'we have gratefully acknowledged the offer of support from the private sector to assist in providing those skills which we lack in government to enable investigation and prosecution of crime', 'to ensure that the prosecuting authority remains true to its constitutional obligation and to ensure transparency we are developing a framework for private sector cooperation that will be managed through national treasury', 'there are also discussions underway with the judiciary for the creation of special court rolls for state capture and corruption cases', 'while we have taken decisive steps to end the era of state capture we know that the fight against corruption is far from over', 'even as the country was suffering the devastation of the covid pandemic companies and individuals were conspiring with public officials to defraud the government of billions of rand in covidrelated contracts', 'as soon as evidence emerged of this corruption we acted', 'we withdrew certain emergency procurement regulations set up a fusion centre that brought together various law enforcement agencies published the details of all covidrelated contracts online and instituted the most extensive investigation that the special investigating unit siu has undertaken since its formation', 'in december the siu submitted its final report on its investigation into covidrelated contracts', 'as a result  matters with a combined value of r', ' billion have been enrolled with the special tribunal', 'the siu has referred  government officials for disciplinary action and referred  cases for possible prosecution to the npa', 'the presidency has set up mechanisms to monitor implementation of the recommendations of the siu and ensure that government departments and entities act against those who have violated regulations and broken the law', 'the fight against corruption will take on a new intensity thanks to the outcomes of the state capture commission the strengthening of law enforcement agencies and the implementation of new anticorruption practices in the public service', 'soes play a vital role in our economy', 'from water and roads to energy and ports to defence and aviation these strategic assets are necessary to keep our country running', 'it is essential that we reverse their decline and position them to contribute positively', 'we have therefore embarked on several immediate measures to restore these companies to health at the same time as we undertake farreaching reforms that will make our soes more efficient competitive accountable and sustainable', 'the presidential soe council which i appointed in  has recommended that government adopt a centralised shareholder model for its key commercial stateowned companies', 'this would separate the states ownership functions from its policymaking and regulatory functions minimise the scope for political interference introduce greater professionalism and manage state assets in a way that protects shareholder value', 'as part of this preparatory work has begun for the establishment of a stateowned holding company to house strategic soes and to exercise coordinated shareholder oversight', 'to ensure that soes are effectively fulfilling their responsibilities the presidential soe council is preparing recommendations on soes to be retained consolidated or disposed of', 'any recommendations would be subject to extensive consultation with all stakeholders', 'we are taking steps to safeguard our democracy protect our economic infrastructure and build safer communities for all', 'earlier this week we released the report of the expert panel into the civil unrest in july last year', 'the report paints a deeply disturbing picture of the capabilities of our security services and the structures that exist to coordinate their work', 'the report concludes that governments initial handling of the july  events was inept police operational planning was poor there was poor coordination between the state security and intelligence services and police are not always embedded in the communities they serve', 'the expert panel said that if the violence has exposed anything it was the poverty and inequality that is the root cause of the desperation of the people of south africa', 'the expert panel found that cabinet must take overall responsibility for the events of july ', 'this is a responsibility that we acknowledge and accept', 'we will as recommended by the panel develop and drive a national response plan to address the weaknesses that the panel has identified', 'we will begin immediately by filling critical vacancies and addressing positions affected by suspensions in the state security agency and crime intelligence', 'we will soon be announcing leadership changes in a number of security agencies to strengthen our security structures', 'the staffing of the public order policing unit of the south african police service will be brought to an appropriate level with appropriate training courses in place', 'the ongoing damage to and theft of economic infrastructure has damaged confidence and severely constrained economic growth investment and job creation', 'at the same time we need to confront the criminal gangs that invade construction sites and other business places to extort money from companies', 'this requires a focused and coordinated response', 'government has therefore established specialise multidisciplinary units to address economic sabotage extortion at construction sites and vandalism of infrastructure', 'we will make resources available to recruit and train an additional   new police personnel to ensure that the south african police service urgently gets the capacity it needs', 'another area of immediate attention will be the reestablishment of community policing forums to improve relations and coordination between local police and residents of the areas they serve', 'it is clear from the observations of the expert panel that we need to take a more inclusive approach to assessing the threats to our countrys security and determining the necessary responses', 'i am calling on all south africans through their various formations to participate in developing our national security strategy', 'i will be approaching parliaments presiding officers to request that parliament plays a key role in facilitating inclusive processes of consultation', 'the security services have been tasked by the national security council to urgently develop implementation plans that address the range of recommendations made by the expert panel', 'these measures will go a long way to address the serious concerns about the breakdown of law and order in society', 'this year we are intensifying the fight against genderbased violence and femicide through implementation of the national strategic plan on genderbased violence and femicide and other measures to promote the empowerment of women', 'earlier this month i signed into law three new pieces of legislation which has strengthened the criminal justice system promoting accountability across the state and supporting survivors', 'the implementation of this legislation will go a long way to ensuring that cases are successfully prosecuted that survivors are protected and that there are more effective deterrents in place', 'we have made significant progress in reducing the backlog in dna processing reducing it from   exhibits in april  to around   at present', 'however the fight against genderbased violence will never be won unless as society we mobilise all formations and all citizens behind a sustained programme of social action', 'as the covid pandemic has starkly demonstrated a nations health is inextricably linked with its economic progress and social development', 'we will therefore continue with the work underway to ensure universal health coverage for everyone in south africa regardless of their ability to pay', 'while public hearings on the national health  nhi bill are continuing in parliament much progress is being made in preparing for the introduction of nhi', 'more than  million people are registered in the health patient registration system', 'by september  more than   additional health workers had been recruited and more than   community health workers integrated into the public health system', 'for the last two years the education of our children and young people has been severely disrupted', 'as we return to normal educational activity we will work harder to ensure that all learners and students get the quality education they need and deserve', 'fellow south africans  government must work for the people', 'that is why our foremost priority is to build a capable ethical and developmental state', 'we will soon be finalising a framework for the professionalisation of the public service', 'this will include tighter measures for recruitment of public servants continuous professional development through the national school of government and partnerships between state bodies professional associations and universities', 'lifestyle audits are already being implemented across the public service', 'this year we will continue with the implementation of the ddm', 'this model brings all three spheres of government together with other social partners in every district to grow inclusive local economies and improve the lives of citizens', 'in particular the ddm facilitates integrated planning and budgeting across spheres of government and improves integration of national projects at a district level', 'while there are many parts of the state that require much work there are institutions that continue to serve the people of this country effectively and efficiently', 'one such institution is the sars which will be  years old this year', 'while sars was badly damaged by state capture it has made remarkable progress in restoring its integrity credibility and performance', 'since its formation sars has collected some r trillion for the countrys social and economic development', 'this revenue has enabled government to improve the lives of millions through the provision of healthcare education social grants and other basic services', 'a capable state is not only about the quality of public servants and the efficiency of institutions', 'it is also fundamentally about how citizens are empowered to participate', 'we must work together to ensure that platforms like schools governing bodies and community policing forums are more active and inclusive', 'a vibrant civil society is crucial for a capable state and for development', 'we will therefore be working with social partners to convene the longawaited social sector summit', 'this summit will seek to improve the interface between the state and civil society and address the challenges that nongovernmental organisations and communitybased organisations face', 'our country has suffered several damaging blows in recent times', 'a confluence of forces many of them outside of our control has brought us to where we are now', 'we face steep and daunting challenges', 'indeed we are engaged in a battle for the soul of this country', 'but there can be no doubt that we will win', 'i ask every south african to rally together in our fight against corruption in our fight to create jobs in our fight to achieve a more just and equal society', 'we have faced many crises in our past and we have overcome them', 'we have been confronted with difficult choices and we have made them', 'in trying times we have shown courage and resilience  time and time again we have pulled ourselves back from the brink of despair and inspired hope renewal and progress', 'now we must do so again', 'let us forge a new consensus to confront a new reality a consensus that unites us behind our shared determination to reform our economy and rebuild our institutions', 'let us get to work', 'let us rebuild our country', 'and let us leave no one behind', 'i thank you']"

occasion', 'speaking at the very first annual regular opening of our democratic parliament on  may  almost a month after the historic april th elections in which for the first time ever the people of our country freely decided together who should govern our country the honourable nelson mandela issued an historic challenge that  we must constrained by and yet regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical burdens seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny', '  perhaps what the nation has done and not done during the years of the democratic epoch that have accumulated since nelson mandela delivered the first state of the nation address on  may  has created the possibility for us to reiterate the call he made on that day to all of us as south africans nearly twelve years ago together to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny', '  on that day in may  the hon nelson mandela evoked the haunting memory of an extraordinary south african ingrid jonker who committed suicide just over  years ago in the same sea waters that isolated his former involuntary temporary home robben island from our mainland as she was isolated from and by her kith and kin', 'of her he said  in the midst of despair she celebrated hope', 'confronted with death she asserted the beauty of life', 'in the dark days when all seemed hopeless in our country when many refused to hear her resonant voice she took her own life', 'to her and others like her we owe a debt to life itself', 'to her and others like her we owe a commitment to the poor the oppressed the wretched and the despised', '  nelson mandela said that in the aftermath of the massacre at the antipass demonstrations in sharpeville langa and nyanga she wrote that  die kind is nie dood nie  die kind lig sy vuiste teen sy moeder  wat afrika skreeu      die kind wat net wou speel in die son by nyanga als orals  die kind wat n man geword het trek deur die ganse afrika  die kind wat n reus geword het reis deur die hele wreld   sonder n pas   the child is not dead the child lifts his fists against his mother who shouts africa', 'this child who only wanted to play in the sun at nyanga is everywhere the child grown to a man treks on through all africa the child grown to a giant journeys through the whole world without a pass  nelson mandela continued  and in this glorious vision ingrid jonker instructs that our endeavours must be about the liberation of the woman the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child', 'it is these things that we must achieve to give meaning to our presence in this chamber and give purpose to our occupancy of the seat of government', 'and so we must constrained by and yet regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical burdens seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny', '  confronted by this historic challenge i dare say that no one in our country can like shakespeares macbeth grieve that in the period since that distinguished son of our people the honourable nelson mandela delivered our first state of the nation address all we can truthfully say with macbeth about our countrys fate is  tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death  indeed i believe that for many of us our countrys evolution away from its apartheid past seems to have moved at such a hectic pace that even some of the seminal moments marking the birth of our democracy that are less than two decades old present themselves in the subconscious mind as being mere chapters in an aging historical record of a distant past', 'nothing that has happened during the age of democracy could justify the conclusion similar to the one that macbeth arrived at that any of our yesterdays has only served to guide fools to avoidable catastrophe', 'on the contrary the age of democracy has given itself moral legitimacy by ensuring that ingrid jonker lives on a heroine to all our people', 'the child she knew had not died despite the apartheid bullet through its head', 'and now grown to a giant treks on through all africa and the whole world without a pass  this year we will have occasion to remind ourselves of and celebrate two of the seminal moments to which i have referred', 'one of these is the th anniversary of the holding of the first meeting of convention for a democratic south africa codesa on  december  and the adoption of the vitally important declaration of intent the following day', 'the other is the th anniversary of the adoption of our constitution on  may ', 'among other things the codesa declaration of intent said  wedeclare our solemn commitment to bring about an undivided south africa with one nation sharing a common citizenship patriotism and loyalty pursuing amidst our diversity freedom equality and security for all irrespective of race colour sex or creed  a country free from apartheid or any other form of discrimination or domination', '  the importance of this particular moment in our history both for our country and the peoples of the world was underlined by the presence at codesa of international observers from the united nations the organisation of african unity the movement of nonaligned countries and the commonwealth', 'in a joint statement these representatives of important international organisations said codesa must herald the dawn of a new era of peace and justice', 'the broad objectives expressed in the declaration of intent are a most constructive and auspicious beginning for codesa and give promise of attainment of a true democracy for south africawe hope that all the representatives of the south african people will join in the rebuilding of their country', 'periods of a decade and a decadeandahalf are but fleeting moments in the life of any nation', 'in our case we have lived through these years conscious of the enormous effort it would require of all of us to unshackle our country from the heavy chains that tie it to its past', 'we have known that it would take considerable time before we could say we have eradicated the legacy of the past', 'we have expected that the circumstances handed down to us by our history would indeed condemn us to a petty pace of progress towards the achievement of the goal of a better life for all', 'and yet today as i stand here to speak to the honourable members of our national provincial and local legislatures an important component part of our national political leadership other echelons of that leadership and our international guests i feel emboldened to appropriate for our people the promise contained in the book of the prophet isaiah when god said  for you shall go out with joy and be led out in peace  the mountains and the hills shall break forth into singing before you and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands', 'instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress tree and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree  kuba niya kuphuma ninovuyo nithundezwe ninoxolo', 'iintaba

since nelson mandela delivered his first state of the nation address and what we can do given the larger resources that have since been generated has surely given hope to the masses of our people that it is possible for all africa to hear the mountains and the hills singing before them', 'when he addressed the united nations general assembly  years ago on  february  a mere two months after our nation established codesa the then chairperson of the united nations special committee against apartheid said  during the next few months the special committee will need to closely monitor developments in order to identify all factors threatening to derail the process in south africa and to issue early warnings accordingly', 'we will thus pay particular attention to the underlying causes of violence', 'the level and the nature of violence continues to be extremely disturbing', 'more than   persons lost their lives in  as a result of politically related violence', '  reading this today wondering what could have gone wrong that so many people had to lose their lives needlessly it becomes difficult to avoid the conclusion that  yesterday was another country  and yet during the very same year that we adopted our constitution amnesty international could still report that  at least  people were killed in continuing political violence in kwazulunatal  some appeared to have been extrajudicially executed', 'reports of torture and illtreatment in police custody continued', 'four people were killed by rightwing opponents of the government', 'further evidence emerged through court proceedings and truth and reconciliation commission hearings of official involvement in human rights violations under the former government', '  fifteen years ago the international community was expressing deep concern about factors threatening to derail the process in our country towards ending white minority rule including the violence then claiming too many lives and found it necessary to appeal to all our people to act together to end apartheid and rebuild the country', 'the peoples of the world could have reiterated their concern about political violence in our country even five years later as we took the giant step forward by adopting our constitution', 'happily in time we managed to break free of the uncertainty about a bright future for our country dramatically represented by the large numbers of people killed throughout the years from  to  when we were engaged in negotiations to establish our democratic order', 'this year opened with the inspiring news that our people were highly optimistic about their future and the future of our country ranking eighth in the world on the optimism index', 'gallup international which issued this report said we have three times more optimists than pessimists and that the optimism figure had doubled even since ', 'this compared sharply with the situation in  when our country was still in the grip of the crisis that had been of so much concern to the international community', 'that year our country had more pessimists than optimists signifying the prevalence of a mood of despair generated in part by the coldblooded assassination that year of one of our outstanding leaders chris hani', 'the results obtained by gallup international have been confirmed by a recent domestic poll conducted by markinor', 'according to this poll  of our people believe that the country is going in the right direction', ' think that our country holds out a happy future for all racial groups', ' believe that government is performing well', 'with regard to the economy late last month the grant thornton international business owners survey reported that  of south africas business owners are optimistic about the year ahead making them the third most optimistic internationally', 'again last month the first national bank and the bureau for economic research reported that the consumer confidence index is at its highest in  years', 'what all these figures signify is that our people are firmly convinced that our country has entered its age of hope', 'they are convinced that we have created the conditions to achieve more rapid progress towards the realisation of their dreams', 'they are certain that we are indeed a winning nation', 'through our national effort they can see the relevance to our situation of gods blessings communicated in the book of the prophet isaiah  for you shall go out with joy and be led out in peace  the mountains and the hills shall break forth into singing before you and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands', 'instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress tree and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree   the inspiring perspective about our future shared by the majority of our people derives from what our country has achieved first to overcome the obstacles to freedom we faced before  the advances we have made since then to consolidate our democracy while promoting nonracism and nonsexism the progress we have made to alleviate the poverty afflicting millions of our people and the strides we have made to expand and modernise our economy', 'we owe these outstanding achievements to the sterling efforts made by all our people in all walks of life', 'to that extent i would like to take the opportunity of this state of the nation address to salute and thank all our people for responding to the call made by nelson mandela in  from this podium when he said we must constrained by and yet regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical burdens seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny', '  millions did indeed seize the time and in action defined ours as a shared destiny of peace democracy nonracism nonsexism shared prosperity and a better life for all', 'it is because of what these millions did that our people know from their own experience that today is better than yesterday and are confident that tomorrow will be better than today', 'while we must indeed celebrate the high levels of optimism that inspire our people who are convinced that our country has entered its age of hope we must also focus on and pay particular attention to the implications of those high levels of optimism with regard to what we must do together to achieve the objective of a better life for all our people', 'we have to respond to the hopes of the people by doing everything possible to meet their expectations', 'and here i include among those who have to respond to the high expectations of our people not just the government but also the private sector the labour unions and the rest of civil society and patriotic individuals', 'in the period ahead of us we have to sustain the multifaceted national effort that enabled us to realise the advances that have inspired so much confidence among our people for a better tomorrow', 'on behalf of our government i would therefore like to use this important landmark in our national life to repeat the appeal made by nelson mandela  years ago that together we mustseize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny', '  and i dare say that essentially all of us are very familiar with what the people expect which would confirm that they were not wrong to conclude that our country has entered its age of hope', 'the markinor survey to which we have referred indicates some of the concerns of our people', 'whereas as we have indicated  believe that government is generally performing well only  think government is responding well to our economic challenges with the figure dropping to  with regard to the cluster of justice functions', 'we must also note that the governments approval rating with regard to the economy moves in tandem with the levels of income', 'significantly  approve of the governments efforts in various areas of social delivery', 'in contrast only  believe that the sphere of local government is performing well', 'the honourable members will also be pleased to know that a survey conducted by the government communication and information system gcis shows that  of our population is proud of our country our flag and national anthem while  consider freedom day april th as the most important national day', 'the outcomes of these surveys communicate the unequivocal message that our people expect that   we should move faster to address the challenges of poverty underdevelopment and marginalisation confronting those caught within the second economy to ensure that the poor in our country share in our growing prosperity   we should make the necessary interventions with regard to the first economy to accelerate progress towards the achievement of higher levels of economic growth and development of at least  a year   we must sustain and improve the effectiveness of our social development programmes targeted at providing a cushion of support to those most exposed to the threat of abject poverty   we must act more aggressively with regard to our criminal justice system to improve the safety and security of our people especially by improving the functioning of our courts and increasing our conviction rates to strengthen the message that crime does not pay   we must ensure that the machinery of government especially the local government sphere discharges its responsibilities effectively and efficiently honouring the precepts of batho pele  and  we must harness the proudly south african spirit that is abroad among the people to build the strongest possible partnership between all sections of our population to accelerate our advance towards the realisation of the important goal of a better life for all', 'our government is committed to respond with all necessary seriousness and determination to all these challenges and play its role to give new content to our age of hope', 'i am honoured to have this opportunity to announce some of the elements of the programme of our government to honour this commitment', 'the honourable members and the country at large are aware that under the leadership of deputy president phumzile mlambongcuka the three spheres of government have been working together for some months to elaborate the specific interventions that will ensure that asgisa the accelerated and shared growth initiative of south africa succeeds in its purposes which include the reduction of the unemployment levels', 'in this regard i would like to thank the members of the private sector the trade union movement women youth and civil society who have participated in this process making a valuable input into an important initiative that must be owned and implemented by our people as a whole', 'i must also take advantage of this occasion to explain that asgisa is not intended to cover all elements of a comprehensive development plan', 'rather it consists of a limited set of interventions that are intended to serve as catalysts to accelerated and shared growth and development', 'otherwise we will continue to engage the nation and all social partners to address other elements of a comprehensive development plan to improve on our current programmes and deal with other issues such as the comprehensive industrial policy keeping in mind the objective to halve poverty and unemployment by ', 'our government is convinced that favourable conditions exist for us to achieve the accelerated and shared growth to which we are committed', 'for instance on  january  the newspaper business day commented that  in south africa this promises to be the dawn of a golden age of growthwe have now had more than five years of sustained growth  an upswing longer than the boom of the s and indeed longer than anything in the postwar periodwe are reaping the benefits of years of sound financial and monetary policy as well as of structural reform in the economy', 'we are set fairer than we have been in decades to raise the growth rate on a sustainable basis', 'the trouble is not all of it is within our control as much depends on the vagaries of world markets and the global economy  but make no mistakethis economy and this market starts to look very different to anything we are used to', 'and it is certainly a different good not a different bad', 'we fully agree with these observations and would add that that different good has included significant job creation a trend that we seek to enhance through asgisa and our other development programmes', 'to implement asgisa the stateowned enterprises and the public sector as a whole working in some instances through publicprivate partnerships will make large investments in various sectors to   meet the demand for electricity   provide an efficient and competitive logistic infrastructure   expand and modernise the telecommunications infrastructure  and  satisfy the demand for water', 'the public sector will also accelerate infrastructure investment in the underdeveloped urban and rural areas of our country through the municipal infrastructure grant expanded public works programme and other infrastructure funds to improve service delivery in the areas of the second economy including the provision of  roads and rail   water   energy   housing schools and clinics   business premises and business support centres   sports facilities  and  multipurpose government service centres including police stations and courts', 'r billion will be provided for both these sets of programmes over the next three years', 'as the honourable members would expect we will continue to pay particular attention to the expanded public works programme as an important bridge between the two economies and a significant part of our poverty alleviation programme', 'among other things resources for the public works programmes will be pooled to ensure maximum impact both in terms of products delivered and employment and skillstraining opportunities', 'better supervision of infrastructure projects undertaken by government will be introduced to ensure that capital budgets are spent without rollovers and that labourintensive methods are prioritised and the necessary training of workers is carried out to provide them with skills', 'asgisa has also identified particular sectors of our economy for accelerated growth building on the work already done within the context of our existing microeconomic reform programme', 'these include   business process outsourcing   tourism   chemicals   biofuels   metals and metallurgy   wood pulp and paper   agriculture   the creative industries  and  clothing and textiles', 'in this regard work is proceeding apace to address such challenges as the cost of telecommunications and import parity pricing with regard to steel and chemicals', 'we have already reached agreement with the peoples republic of china to protect our clothing and textile sector', 'the second national telecommunications operator should become operational later this year', 'for asgisa to succeed it is clear that the machinery of state and especially local government should function effectively and efficiently', 'during the past year our government has undertaken a detailed assessment to determine what we need to do to improve the capacity of our system of local government', 'as we announced last year we have been engaged in assessing the capacity of government to discharge its responsibilities to help accelerate the process of social transformation', 'proceeding from the particular to the general the audit of a number of national departments has been completed', 'these include housing health education and trade and industry', 'across all these issues of skills vacancies delegation of responsibilities to managers of delivery agencies and relationship between national and provincial departments have emerged as being among the most critical areas requiring attention', 'assessments of the other departments will be carried out', 'the government will make the necessary interventions to address the issues raised by these assessments bearing in mind the critical role that government must play as one of our countrys most important developmental agencies', 'we cannot allow that government departments become an obstacle to the achievement of the goal of a better life for all because of insufficient attention to the critical issue of effective and speedy delivery of services', 'in this context we will continue the work towards the creation of one public service covering all spheres of government fully conscious of the complexity of this matter and the need to secure the agreement of all relevant stakeholders', 'we will also continue to pay the necessary attention to the important issues of the inclusion of women and people with disabilities at decisionmaking levels of the public service', 'everything we have said so far concerning asgisa points to the inescapable conclusion that to meet our objectives we will have to pay particular attention to the issue of scarce skills that will negatively affect the capacity of both the public and the private sectors to meet the goals set by asgisa', 'in this regard i would therefore like to assure the honourable members and the country as a whole that together with our social partners we have agreed to a vigorous and wideranging skills development and acquisition programme to meet any shortfalls we may experience', 'among other things we have already agreed to establish within a few weeks a multistakeholder working group jipsa the joint initiative on priority skills acquisition through which government business labour and civil society will act jointly to respond to the skills challenge in as practical a manner as possible', 'i would like to extend the sincere thanks of our deputy president and government as a whole to the response of the freedom front  and other formations and individuals who have responded to our appeal for south africans with the necessary skills to make themselves available to provide the required expertise in project management and other areas', 'the first group of the  already identified and assessed will be deployed in their new posts in may', 'we will of course also make other interventions in the area of education and training', 'these include eliminating fees for the poorest quintile of primary schools targeting  schools to double the maths and science graduate output to   by  and reequipping and financing the further education and training colleges', 'last year we completed the task of registering unemployed graduates with over   in the database', 'we wish to express our appreciation to the many companies that last december pledged to employ some of these graduates', 'an intensive campaign to link up these graduates with these and other companies will be undertaken this year', 'during this year when we celebrate the th anniversary of the establishment of the university of fort hare we will continue to engage the leadership of our tertiary institutions focused on working with them to meet the nations expectations with regard to teaching and research', 'for its part the government is determined to increase the resource allocation for research and development and innovation and increase the pool of young researchers', 'asgisa identified other constraints to growth and development apart from the issue of skills the cost of doing business and the unnecessarily high cost of intermediate inputs', 'work is proceeding to address all these constraints including the limited domestic market and monetary and financial issues', 'asgisa has once more confirmed the need for us to expand our small medium and micro enterprise smme sector paying particular attention in this regard to broadbased black economic empowerment and the development of women and the youth', 'we will therefore take the necessary measures to ensure the effectiveness of such existing programmes as the apex microcredit fund mafisa for agricultural development seda the small enterprise development agency khula the msobomvu youth fund the idc small business initiative and so on', 'we will also intensify our engagement of the financial services charter signatories to help generate the necessary resources for the development of the smme sector', 'our experience with regard to the development of this sector indicates that we must pay particular attention to issues of access to capital entrepreneurial training assistance with marketing and the development of cooperatives', 'further to contribute to the growth of the smme sector the government will reform its procurement programme to access some of its goods and services from small and medium businesses ensuring that it pays for what it purchases promptly', 'we will also speed up the consultative process to determine the measures we must take to improve the regulatory climate to facilitate the expansion of this sector', 'this intervention will form part of the overall programme to introduce a regulatory impact assessment system to enable the government regularly to assess the impact of its policies on economic activity in our country', 'the years of freedom have been very good for business', 'i believe that this should have convinced the investor community by now that in its own interest and as part of the national effort it has to invest in the expansion of that freedom especially by actively and consciously contributing towards the achievement of the goal of halving poverty and unemployment by ', 'asgisa which builds on the results of the growth and development summit offers this investor community an excellent opportunity to respond to this challenge in a deliberate and consistent manner in its own interest', 'similarly and also as part of the national effort the trade union movement and civil society as a whole face the challenge to translate into action the commitment they made with the other social partners at the growth and development summit to a common vision for promoting rising levels of growth investment job creation and peoplecentred development', '  asgisa provides a golden opportunity for the social partners to undertake the collaborative action they visualised at the gds focused on promoting and mobilising investment and creating decent work for all', '  the impressive growth rates achieved by our economy in the current period have been driven in good measure by high consumer demand significantly financed through credit', 'this has increased our imports more than our exports', 'despite high commodity prices the resultant balance of payments deficit has been financed by inflows of foreign capital', 'through asgisa we will increase the significance of the supplyside drivers of our growth', 'a corollary of this is of course that we must ensure the international competitiveness of the goods and services we produce', 'this speaks directly to the common objective agreed by the social partners at the growth and development summit to promote rising levels of growth investment job creation and peoplecentred development', '  i have already mentioned the fact that to meet our developmental objectives which must respond to the high expectations of our people we will pay special attention to the critical task of strengthening local government', 'our government considers this to be especially important at this stage of our evolution', 'after the march st local government elections all three spheres of government will therefore continue working together to ensure that each and every district and metro municipality is properly positioned to discharge its responsibility to the people', 'in particular this will mean that each of these municipalities has a realistic integrated development plan a credible local economic development programme and the material and human resources as well as the management and operational systems to implement these idps and leds', 'integration of planning and implementation across the government spheres is therefore one of the prime areas of focus in our programme for the next term of local government', 'in this regard we will be guided by the intergovernmental relations framework act', 'we must in practice respect the system of cooperative governance and within this context ensure that we empower local government to discharge its development and service delivery obligations drawing on the lessons provided by project consolidate', 'as many of us are aware by now project consolidate has identified serious capacity constraints in many of our municipalities arising from a shortage of properly qualified managers professional and technical personnel', 'we have taken the necessary decisions to attend to this urgent matter', 'to improve the ability particularly of local government to meet the needs of the people by march this year we shall have deployed   community development workers', 'even as we implement the programmes focused on accelerated and shared growth with its important element of job creation we cannot forget that the social wage plays a vital role in our continuing efforts to address the challenge of poverty', 'for instance  million children now receive the child support grant', 'a total of  million of our citizens receive social grants', 'real social expenditure per person increased by  between  and ', 'detailed evidence from a study conducted by haroon bhorat prakash naidoo and carlene van der westhuizen indicates that there has been a consistent shift in expenditure in favour of poorer households', 'to improve delivery in this area we will continue to implement our comprehensive antifraud strategy', 'already many of those who have been stealing social grants have been brought to book', 'this work will improve with the launch of the national social security agency', 'in the area of health over   clinics have benefited from the upgrading programme and more have received additional equipment  and the programme to revitalise hospitals is proceeding apace', 'the extension of community service to a range of health professionals has ensured that at any one time over   such professionals are available in public health institutions', 'our future plans in this area include the further expansion of the health infrastructure the refurbishment of existing clinics and hospitals and the reopening of nursing colleges to increase the numbers of these important professionals', 'to improve service delivery in our hospitals by september this year we will ensure that hospital managers are delegated authority and held accountable for the functioning of hospitals with policy issues regarding training job grading and accountability managed by provincial health departments which themselves will need restructuring properly to play their role', 'the operational plan for comprehensive prevention treatment and care of hiv and aids has resulted in the upgrading of hundreds of facilities', 'to date over   patients are receiving antiretroviral treatment and combined with patients in the private sector south africa has one of the largest such treatment programme in the world', 'during the course of this year in addition to accelerating the expansion of our housing stock to address the needs of the homeless we will take concrete steps to ensure that housing development contributes to eliminating the duality of living spaces inherited from apartheid', 'already the ministry of housing and the south african local government association have reached an agreement on the sale of land for housing development', 'through this agreement municipalities will allocate land close to economic centres for housing development for middle and lower income people', 'in addition as part of our effort to help the poor to access housing finance the national housing finance corporation nhfc will be transformed into a housing corporation that will provide finance to the poor and middleincome groups', 'in this context we expect our minister of housing and the leadership of the financial institutions to reach final agreement without further delay on the modalities for utilising the r billion set aside by the financial institutions for housing development for poor and middleincome groups thus contributing to the national effort', 'this is central to the attainment of a society free of shack settlements in which all our people enjoy decent housing', 'in this context i should also mention that government has decided that we must completely eradicate in the established settlements the bucket toilets by the end of ', 'land reform and land restitution are critical to the transformation of our society', 'accordingly the state will play a more central role in the land reform programme ensuring that the restitution programme is accelerated further contributing to the

systems ever put together by human beings apartheid', 'a nation of people with courage', 'a nation of people with great commitment', 'we also said that it is through our actions now that we will determine our destiny', 'as south africa enters the next  years of democracy and in pursuit of the objectives of the ndp let us proclaim a bold and ambitious goal a unifying purpose to which we dedicate all our resources and energies', 'as we enter the last decade of vision  let us even more clearly define the south africa we want and agree on the concrete actions we need to achieve them',

priorities', 'let us agree as a nation and as a people united in our aspirations that within the next  years we will have made progress in tackling poverty inequality and unemployment where  no person in south africa will go hungry', 'this is a bold plan which i believe we will achieve', 'our economy will grow at a much faster rate than our population', 'two million more young people will be in employment', 'our schools will have better educational outcomes and every yearold will be able to read for meaning', 'violent crime will be halved if not eliminated', 'let us make these commitments now  to ourselves and to each other  knowing that they will stretch our resources and capabilities but understanding that if we achieve these five goals we will have fundamentally transformed our society', 'we set these ambitious goals not despite the severe difficulties of the present but because of them', 'we set these goals so that the decisions we take now are bolder and we act with greater urgency', 'our determination that within the next decade no person in south africa will go hungry is fundamental to our effort to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality', 'in addition to creating employment and other economic opportunities this means that we must strengthen the social wage and reduce the cost of living', 'it means we must improve the affordability safety and integration of commuter transport for lowincome households', 'while we have made great progress in providing housing many south africans still need land to build homes and earn livelihoods', 'in the next five years we will accelerate the provision of welllocated housing and land to poor south africans', 'to improve the quality of life of south africans to reduce poverty in all its dimensions and to strengthen our economy we will attend to the health of our people', 'we must attend to the capacity of our hospitals and clinics', 'an yearold grandmother cannot and should not spend an entire day in a queue waiting for her medication', 'an ill patient cannot be turned away because there is a shortage of doctors and nurses', 'a woman in labour cannot have her unborn childs life put in danger because the ambulance has taken too long to arrive', 'as part of the work we must urgently do to improve the quality of the health system we are finalising the presidential health summit compact which draws on the insights and will mobilise the capabilities of all key stakeholders to address the crisis in our clinics and hospitals', 'we are far advanced in revising the national health insurance nhi detailed plan of implementation including accelerating quality of care initiatives in public facilities building human resource capacity establishment of the nhi fund structure and costing the administration of the nhi fund', 'we remain concerned about rising hiv infections rates particularly among young women and the relatively low numbers of men testing for hiv and starting treatment',

than our population', 'it is only when we reach consistently high rates of growth that we will be able to reverse the economic damage of our past', 'we make this assertion at a time when the economic outlook is extremely weak', 'following the sharp contraction in growth in the first quarter the reserve bank now projects that growth in  is likely to be lower than anticipated in the february budget', 'one reason for the lacklustre economic performance has been the load shedding early this year together with the continued uncertainty in the supply of electricity and the state of eskom',

this year eskom has made much progress in implementing its ninepoint plan ensuring better maintenance of its generation fleet reducing costs and ensuring adequate reserves of coal', 'in line with the recommendations of both the eskom sustainability task team and the technical review team eskom is deploying its most skilled and experienced personnel to where they are needed most', 'the utilitys financial position remains a matter of grave concern', 'with the current committed funding from government outlined in the  budget eskom has sufficient cash to meet its obligations until the end of october ', 'for eskom to default on its loans will cause a crossdefault on its remaining debt and would have a huge impact on the already constrained fiscus', 'we will therefore have to address this matter by  tabling a special appropriation bill on an urgent basis to allocate a significant portion of the r billion fiscal support that eskom will require over the next  years in the early years', 'this we must do because eskom is too vital to our economy to be allowed to fail', 'eskom is our collective responsibility as a nation and we must ensure that we support it', 'further details will be provided by the minister of finance in due course', 'we will announce the appointment of a new chief executive officer following the stepping down of mr phakamani hadebe', 'he came in at a very difficult time at eskom and has done a great deal together with the board led by mr jabu mabuza to stabilise the company', 'we will soon also be appointing a chief restructuring officer who will be

address its broad structural plan and its overall debt as well as the debt owed by municipalities and individual users', 'as a country we must assert the principle that those who use electricity must pay for it', 'failure to pay endangers our entire electricity supply our economy and our efforts to create jobs', 'the days of boycotting payment are over', 'this is now the time to build it is the time for all of us to make our own contribution', 'so we call on all our people who use electricity to pay so that eskom can be able to deliver', 'fellow south africans  to meet our growth targets we will rebuild the foundations of our economy by revitalising and expanding the productive sectors', 'this requires us to reimagine our industrial strategy to unleash private investment and energise the state to boost economic inclusion', 'it requires the state to effectively play its role as an enabler that provides basic services and critical infrastructure a regulator that sets rules that create equitable opportunities for all players and a redistributor that ensures that the most vulnerable in society are protected and given a chance to live up to their full potential', 'there is another role we want the state to play that is the entrepreneurial role', 'a role where a state is able to take some risks and enable the economy to grow', 'we will give priority attention to the economic

south africans that we are africans and that we are citizens of the world', 'the certainties that come with age tell me that among these we shall find an afrikaner woman who transcended a particular experience and became a south african an african and a citizen of the world', 'her name is ingrid jonker', 'she was both a poet and a south african', 'she was both an afrikaner and an african', 'she was both an artist and a human being', 'in the midst of despair she celebrated hope', 'confronted with death she asserted the beauty of life', 'in the dark days when all seemed hopeless in our country when many refused to hear her resonant voice she took her own life', 'to her and others like her we owe a debt to life itself', 'to her and others like her we owe a commitment to the poor the oppressed the wretched and the despised', 'in the aftermath of the massacre at the antipass demonstration in sharpeville she wrote that  the child is not dead the child lifts his fists against his mother who shouts africa', 'the child is not dead not at langa nor at nyanga nor at orlando nor at sharpeville nor at the police post at philippi where he lies with a bullet through his brain', 'the

child grown to a man treks on through all africa the child grown to a giant journeys over the whole world without a pass  and in this glorious vision she instructs that our endeavours must be about the liberation of the woman the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child', 'it is these things that we must achieve to give meaning to our presence in this chamber and to give purpose to our occupancy of the seat of government', 'and so we must constrained by and yet regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical burdens seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny', 'the government i have the honour to lead and i dare say the masses who elected us to serve in this role are inspired by the single vision of creating a peoplecentred society', 'accordingly the purpose that will drive this government shall be the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment the continuous extension of the frontiers of the freedom', 'the acid test of the legitimacy of the programmes we elaborate the government institutions we create the legislation we adopt must be whether they serve these objectives', 'our single most important challenge is therefore to help establish a social order in which the freedom of the individual will truly mean the freedom of the individual', 'we must construct that peoplecentred society of freedom in such a manner that it guarantees the political and the human rights of all our citizens', 'as an affirmation of the governments commitment to an entrenched human rights culture we shall immediately take steps to inform the secretary general of the united nations that we will subscribe to the universal declaration of human rights', 'we shall take steps to ensure that we accede to the international covenant on civil and political rights the international covenant on social and economic rights and other human rights instruments of the united nations', 'our definition of the freedom of the individual must be instructed by the fundamental objective to restore the human dignity of each and every south african', 'this requires that we speak not only of political freedoms', 'my governments commitment to create a peoplecentred society of liberty binds us to the pursuit of the goals of freedom from want freedom from hunger freedom from deprivation freedom from ignorance freedom from suppression and freedom from fear', 'these freedoms are fundamental to the guarantee of human dignity', 'they will therefore constitute part of the centrepiece of what this government will seek to achieve the focal point on which our attention will be continuously focused', 'the things we have said constitute the true meaning the justification and the purpose of the reconstruction and development programme without which it would lose all legitimacy', 'when we elaborated this programme we were inspired by the hope that all south africans of goodwill could join together to provide a better life for all', 'we were pleased that other political organisations announced similar aims', 'today i am happy to announce that the cabinet of the government of national unity has reached consensus not only on the broad objective of the creation of the peoplecentred society of which i have spoken but also on many elements of a plan broadly based on that programme for reconstruction and development', 'let me indicate some of the more important agreements', 'annually in the combined budgets of central government and the provinces we will provide for an increasing amount of funding for the plan', 'this will start with an appropriation of r billion in the  budget that will be presented next month', 'this should rise to more than r billion by the fifth year of the life of this government', 'government will also use its own allocation of funds to the reconstruction and development plan to exert maximum leverage in marshalling funds from within south africa and abroad', 'in this regard i am pleased to report that we have been holding consultation with some of the principal business leaders of our country', 'consequently we are assured that the business sector can and will make a significant contribution towards the structuring and management of such reconstruction and development funds towards the effective identification and implementation of projects and by supporting the financing of the socioeconomic development effort', 'i am also pleased to report that many of our friends abroad have already made commitments to assist us to generate the reconstruction and development funds we need', 'we thank them most sincerely for their positive attitude which arises not from objectives of charity but from the desire to express solidarity with the new society we seek to build', 'we accept the duty of coordinating the management of the total resources that will be generated without seeking to prescribe to other contributors or undermining the continued role of nongovernmental organisations and communitybased organisations', 'the initial r billion will be found from savings and the redirection of spending as included in the preliminary  budget proposals presented to cabinet', 'i would like to thank the departments of state for their cooperation in carrying out this adjustment to their planning at short notice', 'as we allocate larger amount in future we shall require further adjustments by departments partly to correct the bias in the spending patterns which are a legacy of the past', 'the longer period shall allow such changes to be properly planned', 'but they will still make great demands on the managerial capacity and spirit of cooperation of the cabinet and the whole civil service', 'we are confident that motivated by the desire to serve the people the public service will discharge its responsibilities with diligence sensitivity and enthusiasm among other things paying attention to the important goal of increasing efficiency and productivity', 'my government is equally committed to ensure that we use this longer period properly fully to bring into the decisionmaking processes organs of civil society', 'this will include the trade union movement and civic organisations so that at no time should the government become isolated from the people', 'at the same time steps will be taken to build the capacity of communities to manage their own affairs', 'precisely because we are committed to ensuring sustainable growth and development leading to a better life for all we will continue existing programmes of fiscal rehabilitation', 'we are therefore determined to make every effort to contain real general government consumption at present levels and to manage the budget deficit with a view to its continuous reduction', 'similarly we are agreed that a permanently higher general level of taxation is to be avoided', 'to achieve these important objectives will require consistent discipline on the part of both the central and the provincial governments', 'furthermore this disciplined approach will ensure that we integrate the objectives of our reconstruction and development plan within government expenditure and not treat them as incidental to the tasks of government marginalised to the status of mere additions to the level of expenditure', 'there are major areas of desperate need in our society', 'as a signal of its seriousness to address these the government will within the next  days implement various projects under the direct supervision of the president', 'let me briefly mention these', 'children under the age of six and pregnant mothers will receive free medical care in every state hospital and clinic where such need exists', 'similarly a nutritional feeding scheme will be implemented in every primary school where such need is established', 'a concrete process of consultation between the major stakeholders in this area will be organised immediately', 'a programme is already being implemented to electrify   homes during the current financial year', 'a campaign will be launched at every level of government a public works programme designed and all efforts made to involve the private sector organised labour the civics and other community organisations to rebuild our townships restore services in rural and urban areas while addressing the issue of job creation and training especially for our unemployed youth', 'many details of the overall reconstruction and development plan remain to be discussed agreed and put in place', 'but i believe that the broad outline i have given and the immediate initiatives i have mentioned will allow you to share my joy at the progress already made by the government of national unity with regard to this important matter', 'we shall carry out this plan within the context of a policy aimed at building a strong and growing economy which will benefit all our people', 'i would like to deal with a few matters in this regard', 'in support of sustainable economic growth and the macroeconomic objective of government it will remain the primary objective of monetary policy to promote and maintain overall financial stability', 'the reserve bank has the important function of protecting the value of our currency and striving for relative price stability at all times', 'we are pleased that dr chris stals will continue to serve as governor of the reserve bank', 'the battle to reduce the rate of inflation will continue', 'the realisation of many of our objectives for a fair and equal treatment of all our people will not be possible unless we succeed in avoiding high inflation in the economy', 'we also face a major challenge in reentering the global economy while stable prices are vital to the restructuring of our industries and dealing with the critical issue of jobcreation', 'we are blessed with a heritage of a sophisticated financial sector', 'our financial markets are wellplaced to play an important part in the allocation of scarce funds to give effect to our economic development programme', 'it is however also necessary that we think in new ways to meet the challenges of reconstruction and development', 'we therefore welcome recent developments that provide for the creation of community banks', 'we would also like to encourage the greater participation of established financial institutions in the important area of black economic empowerment and support for the development of small and medium business', 'the latter two areas of economic activity will receive the greatest attention of the government because of their importance in deracialising and democratising the economy and creating the jobs which our people need', 'we pay attention to the important matter of consumer protection to shield the ordinary people of our country from unscrupulous business practices', 'we must also clear that we must pay increased attention to tourism', 'the jobs and foreign currency which tourism generates will strongly influence our economy', 'the active and imaginative intervention of all stake stakeholders in this area of our national life must take advantage of the excellent atmosphere created by our peaceful transition to democracy to make tourism a major positive force in the future', 'we look forward to the private sector as a whole playing a central role in achieving the significantly high and sustainable rates of economic growth', 'we are convinced that the growth prospects of this sector will be enhanced by the measures of fiscal discipline contained in our approach to the reconstruction and development programme and by the continued steady course of monetary policy', 'as growth proceeds more domestic savings will progressively become available to finance increased investment at reasonable rates of interest', 'the government is also acutely conscious of the fact that we should work firstly to return the capital account of the balance of payments to equilibrium and in due course to ensure a net inflow of resources consistent with the experience of other countries that enjoy more rapid growth rates', 'the present situation of a dual currency and the existence of an exchange control apparatus is a direct result of the conflict in which our country was embroiled in the past', 'as the situation returns to normal these arrangements will be subjected to critical scrutiny', 'it should be possible to match the steady growth of confidence at home and abroad with other confidence enhancing modifications to everybodys benefit', 'the government will also address all other matters that relate the creation of an attractive investment climate for both domestic and foreign investors conscious of the fact that we have to compete with the rest of the world in terms of attracting in particular foreign direct investment', 'i am pleased that we have already started to address the important question of our trade policy guided by our gatt commitments and the determination systematically to open the economy to global competition in a carefully managed process', 'soon we will also begin trade negotiations with among others the european union the united states our partners in the southern african customs unions and our neighbours in the southern african development community to provide a stable and mutually beneficial framework for our international economic relations', 'we will also be looking very closely at the question of enhancing southsouth cooperation in general as part of the effort to expand our economic links with the rest of the world', 'consistent with our objective of creating a peoplecentred society and effectively to address the critical questions of growth reconstruction and development we will together with organised labour and the private sector pay special attention to the issue of human resource development', 'both the public and the private sectors will be encouraged to regard labour as a resource and not a cost', 'education and training must therefore be looked at very closely to ensure that we empower the workers raise productivity levels and meet the skills needs of a modern economy', 'important work will have to be done in and significant resources devoted to the areas of science and technology including research and development', 'government is also convinced that organised labour is an important partner whose cooperation is crucial for the reconstruction and development of our country', 'that partnership requires among other things that our labour law be reformed so that it is in line with international standards apartheid vestiges are removed and a more harmonious labour relations dispensation is created on the basis of tripartite cooperation between government labour and capital', 'the government is determined forcefully to confront the scourge of unemployment not by way of handouts but by the creation of work opportunities', 'the government will also deal sensitively with the issue of population movements into the country to protect our workers to guard against the exploitation of vulnerable workers and to ensure friendly relations with all countries and peoples', 'the government is also taking urgent measures to deal firmly with drug trafficking some of which is carried out by foreign nationals who are resident in the country', 'we must end racism in the workplace as part of our common offensive against racism in general', 'no more should words like kaffirs hottentots coolies boy girl and baas be part of our vocabulary', 'i also trust that the matter of paying the workers for the public holidays proclaimed in order to ensure their participation in the elections and the inauguration ceremonies will now be resolved as a result of recent consultations', 'this would be a welcome demonstration by the private sector of its involvement in the beautiful future we are all trying to build', 'we have devoted time to a discussion of economic questions because they are fundamental to the realisation of the fundamental objectives of the reconstruction and development programme', 'below i mention some of the work in which the relevant governments are already involved to translate these objectives into reality', 'the government will take steps to ensure the provision of clean water on the basis of the principle of water security for all and the introduction of proper sanitation sensitive to the protection of the environment', 'we are determined to address the dire housing shortage in a vigorous manner acting together with the private sector and the communities in need of shelter', 'health also remains a fundamental building block of the humane society we are determined to create through the implementation of the reconstruction and development programme', 'we must address the needs of the aged and disabled uplift disadvantaged sectors such as the women and the youth and improve the lives of our people in the rural communities and the informal settlements', 'we must invest substantial amounts in education and training and meet our commitment to introduce free and compulsory education for a period of at least  years', 'everywhere we must reinculcate the culture of learning and of teaching and make it possible for this culture to thrive', 'we must combat such social pathologies as widespread poverty the break down of family life crime alcohol and drug abuse the abuse of children women and the elderly and the painful reality of street children', 'we are giving urgent attention to the long waiting lists for the payment of social grants which have developed in some areas owing to lack of funds', 'i am especially pleased that we have a ministry dedicated to the issue of the environment', 'its work must impact on many aspects of national activity and address the question of the wellbeing of society as a whole and the preservation of a healthy environmental future even for generation not yet born', 'as we began this address we borrowed the words of ingrid jonker to focus on the plight of the children our country', 'i would now like to say that the government will as a matter of urgency attend to the tragic and complex question of children and juveniles in detention and prison', 'the basic principle from which we will proceed from now onwards is that we must rescue the children of the nation and ensure that the system of criminal justice must be the very last resort in the case of juvenile offenders', 'i have therefore issued instruction to the departments concerned as a matter of urgency to work out the necessary guidelines which will enable us to empty our prisons of children and to place them in suitable alternative care', 'this is in addition to an amnesty for various categories serving prisoners as will be effected in terms of what i said in my inauguration address two week ago', 'in this context i also need to make the point that the government will also not delay unduly with regard to attending to the vexed and unresolved issue of an amnesty for criminal activities carried out in furtherance of political objectives', 'we will attend to this matter in a balanced and dignified way', 'the nation must come to terms with its past in a spirit of openness and forgiveness and proceed to build the future on the basis of repairing and healing', 'the burden of the past lies heavily on all of us including those responsible for inflicting injury and those who suffered', 'following the letter and the spirit of the constitution we will prepare the legislation which will seek to free the wrongdoers from fear of retribution and blackmail while acknowledging the injury of those who have been harmed so that the individual wrongs injuries fears and hopes affecting individuals are identified and attended to', 'in the meantime summoning the full authority of the position represent we call on all concerned not to take any steps that might in any way impede or compromise the processes of reconciliation which the impending legislation will address', 'the problem of politically motivated violence is still with us', 'we depend on our countrys security forces to deal with this problem using all resources at their disposal', 'in this and in their efforts to deal especially criminal violence they have our personal support and confidence', 'we have also directed that all relevant ministries should engage the structures set up in terms of the national peace accord so that these can be invigorated to pursue their noble mission in the context of the changed circumstances in our country', 'the government will otherwise not spare any effort in ensuring that our security forces enjoy the standing they deserve of being accepted by all our people the defenders of our sovereignty our democratic system the guarantors of a just peace within the country and the safety and security of all citizens and their property', 'let met also take this opportunity to reiterate our assurance to the rest of the public service that the government is firmly committed to the protection of the rights of all members of this service', 'we are also determined to work with the organisations of the service to ensure that we have the democratic nonracial nonsexist honest and accountable corps of public servants which members of the public service themselves desire', 'in this context we must also make the observation that the government will not waver from the principle of achieving parity in remuneration and conditions of service among all workers in the public sector', 'the youth of our country are the valued possession of the nation', 'without them there can be no future', 'their needs are immense and urgent', 'they are at the centre of our reconstruction and development plan', 'to address them acting with the youth themselves the government will engage the representative organisations of the youth and other formations among other things to look at the siting of a broadbased national commission on youth development among the structures of government', 'building on this base the government and the commission would then work together to ensure that the nurturing of our youth stands at the centre of our reconstruction and development without being consigned to a meaningless ghetto of public life', 'similar considerations must attach to the equally important question of the emancipation of the women of our country', 'it is vitally important that all structures of government including the president himself should understand this fully that freedom cannot be achieved unless the women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression', 'all of us must take this on board that the objectives of the reconstruction and development programme will not have been realised unless we see in visible and practical terms that the condition of the women of our country has radically changed for the better and that they have been empowered to intervene in all aspects of life as equals with any other member of society', 'in addition to the establishment of the statutory gender commission provided for in the constitution the government will together with the representatives of the women themselves look at the establishment of organs of government to ensure that all levels of the public sector from top to bottom integrate the central issue of the emancipation of women in their programmes and daily activities', 'tomorrow on africa day the dream of ingrid jonker will come to fruition', 'the child grown to a man will trek through all africa', 'the child grown to a journey will journey over the whole world  without a pass  tomorrow on africa day our new flag will be hoisted in an historic ceremony at the oau headquarters in addis ababa with the oau having already agreed to accept us as its latest member', 'tomorrow on africa day the un security council will meet to lift the last remaining sanctions against south africa and to position the world organisation to relate to our country as an honoured responsible and peaceloving citizen', 'as such the government is involved in discussion to determine what our contribution could be to the search for peace in angola and rwanda to the reinforcement of the peace process in mozambique to the establishment of a new world order of mutually beneficial cooperation justice prosperity and peace for ourselves and for the nations of the world', 'yesterday the cabinet also decided to apply for our country to join the commonwealth', 'this important community of nations is waiting to receive us with open arms', 'we have learnt the lesson that our blemishes speak of what all humanity should not do', 'we understand this fully that our glories point to the heights of what human genius can achieve', 'in our dreams we have a vision of all our country at play in our sportsfields and enjoying deserved and enriching recreation in our theatres galleries beaches mountains plains and game parks in conditions of peace security and comfort', 'our road to that glorious future lies through collective hard work to accomplish the objective of creating a peoplecentred society through the implementation of the vision contained in our reconstruction and development plan', 'let us all get down to work']"

services honourable premiers representatives of local government distinguished guests  at no other point of time have we ever been as well placed as we are today to take decisive forward steps towards the creation of the humane and peoplecentred society for which the organisations that were unbanned ten years ago struggled for many decades', 'it is now ten years since the peoples organisations were unbanned the last political prisoners released and the exiles began the journey back to the land of their birth', 'in the course of a mere decade we ended the entrenched and pernicious system of apartheid white minority rule', 'we have put in place a constitutionally governed and stable democratic system whose permanence has been underwritten by two successful general elections', 'we have put behind us the practice inherent within our social order for three centuries and more of the resolution of competing interests by resort to repression to violence and war', 'we have turned an economy that was headed towards a catastrophic meltdown into one that is poised to advance in a way that will address the needs of all our people', 'where suffering and degradation were the only things that were certain in the lives of millions of our people we have created the situation in which these millions are now better able to carry their pain because hope has taken the place of despair', 'having ended our dark days as a pariah country we can rightly say that today the nations of our common universe are confident that out of south africa will emerge a thing of value that will contribute to the building of a more humane world', 'surely madame speaker we are entitled to make the claim that as a people both black and white we did in a mere decade carry out a multifaceted task whose accomplishment speaks highly of the capacity of our people and all humanity to achieve results which can only be described as good and noble', 'i am therefore privileged to have this opportunity to extend heartfelt congratulations to all our people regardless of race colour and gender for the extraordinary and sustained effort over the last ten years which has enabled the overwhelming majority among us to say  we are proud to be south african  the good that has been done puts into very sharp relief everything that still has to be done to extricate millions of our people from the conditions of poverty of racism of sexism and violations of their human dignity from which too many of our people continue to suffer', 'however i am certain that we are all inspired to act with greater vigour and will indeed act with greater vigour to achieve the fundamental transformation of our country because at no point during its entire history has our country been in a better position to confront the challenges we face than it is today', 'at no other point of time have we ever been as well placed as we are today to take decisive forward steps towards the creation of the humane and peoplecentred society for which the organisations that were unbanned ten years ago struggled for many decades', 'last month the food and allied workers union came across correspondence in the electronic mail of one of our companies', 'this correspondence originated from an engineer within this company who has since been dismissed', 'as the honourable members will recall among other things this engineer wrote   i would like to summarise what the kaffirs have done to stuff up this country since they came into power', 'if a white buys a house he pays transfer duties', 'if a kaffir buys a house it is free of duties because he was previously disadvantaged', 'more than  of the gdp is embezzled by the kaffir politicians and corrupt civil servants', 'the uif and state pension funds have been embezzled', 'our girlfriendswives are in constant threat of being brutally raped by some aids infected kaffir or gang of kaffirs', 'everyday someone you know is either robbed assaulted hijacked or murdered', 'half these black bastards have bought their drivers licences from corrupt traffic cops', 'all i am saying is that aids isnt working fast enough  our successes in the struggle to move our country from apartheid to democracy have led many in our country to reach the premature conclusion that racism in south africa is dead', 'this is despite the obvious and naked fact that to this day and unavoidably the racial divisions inequalities and prejudices of the past continue to characterise our society', 'some in our country are so determined to close their eyes to this reality that those who are forced to swallow the bitter fruit of racial inequality and arrogance are regularly rebuked for speaking out against the pain they continue to endure', 'such unadorned statements as those made by the company engineer serve a very important function in that they bring us face to face with the brutality of the racism that will continue to exist in our society unless all of us engage this monster consciously and systematically', 'after discussions between the government and the human rights commission agreement has been reached that the commission will later this year convene a national congress against racism', 'we are convinced that this important initiative will help to move our country faster towards the realisation of the goal contained in our constitution of the creation of a nonracial society as well as impact positively on our continuing struggle for a nonsexist society', 'during this year the government will therefore give all necessary support to the human rights commission to ensure that it succeeds to engage all sectors of our society in the common effort further to intensify our offensive against racism and sexism', 'next year at the request of the united nations human rights commission and high commissioner mary robinson our country will also host the international conference against racism', 'we feel greatly honoured that the international community in recognition of our commitment to the struggle for a nonracial world should have chosen our country to host such an important international gathering which will be the first of its kind', 'the honourable members will have taken note of the deep concern expressed by various european governments at the growth of the extreme right wing in their part of the world', 'in one of his plays the resistible rise of arturo ui the outstanding german playwright and poet bertold brecht warns against the resurgence of fascism with the unforgettable words  the bitch is in heat again  we are committed to act in unity with the rest of the world to confront this challenge and will therefore begin the work this year together with and under the guidance of the united nations commission for human rights to ensure that the international conference next year discharges its responsibilities to the peoples of the world', 'because we have never been better placed than we are today further to push back the frontiers of racism we are convinced that our own national congress against racism will also succeed to discharge its responsibilities to our people', 'i would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the honourable members for the work they did to approve on time the promotion of equality and prevention of unfair discrimination act and the preferential procurement policy framework act', 'we have assented to these and other pieces of legislation approved last month', 'the government will act to ensure the observance of these laws as part of our common national offensive against all forms of inequality and discrimination including racial and gender inequality and discrimination as well as discrimination on the basis of disability', 'the recently completed gender audit will help us to carry out this task as will the objectives set out in the integrated strategy on disability', 'madame speaker  the elimination of poverty remains one of the central objectives of the government and the country', 'as we are all aware this poverty is intimately related to the issues of racism and sexism which we have been discussing', 'its elimination is fundamental to the realisation of the goal of the restoration of the dignity of all our people', 'accordingly this places high on our agenda the task of ensuring that all of us act together to achieve high and sustained rates of growth for our economy', 'once more we would like to make the point that we have never been better positioned than we are today to achieve the progress we have to attain with regard to this important challenge', 'many major indicators point to the excellent work that has been done to place our country on a strong growth path', 'all indicators also signal that during this year our economy will register much more vigorous growth than it did last year', 'of great importance in this regard indicating the resilience the effective restructuring and therefore the improved international competitiveness of our economy was the success we achieved in withstanding the effects of the east asian economic crisis of the late s', 'let us now turn to some of the major indicators to which we have referred', 'whereas the reuters december  survey resulted in the highest projected gdp growth rates of ', ' and ', ' for the years and respectively the january survey sharply raised these figures to ', ' for both years', 'we should also compare these figures to average gdp growth achieved in the period  which amounted to ', '', 'in  foreign direct investment amounted to r million as compared to just under r', '

down to ', ' during the period ', 'in the last few days because of the sound management of our financial system a major international rating agency ranked south africa with regard to the potential level of nonperforming loans in the same bracket with countries such as austria finland hong kong ireland new zealand norway singapore and spain', 'similarly the announcements made again within the last few days concerning investments in the automobile and air transport sectors by major international corporations reflect the confidence of the international business community in our economy and our country', 'these and other developments vindicate the statement made by mr julian ogilvie thompson chairperson of anglo american plc when he spoke in canada on the st of november last year', 'speaking at the cibc wood grundy annual dinner he said   we believe that foreign investors who have been slow in placing direct investment as opposed to portfolio investment will increasingly share our assessment that south africa is one of the most attractive emerging markets', '  our government fully shares this confidence which was also communicated to us by all the business leaders with whom we had the privilege to interact at the world economic forum at davos', 'when we spoke at the opening of our second democratic parliament in june we reported on steps that would be taken further to enhance the partnership between the public and private sectors with a view further to reinforce the growth and development of our economy', 'the four working groups we announced have now been established', 'three of these have already met', 'the four working groups comprise  big business  the trade union federations  black business  and the agricultural sector', 'of these only the latter group has not yet convened owing to time constraints', 'these working groups do not replace nedlac but provide the possibility for government to interact with these various sectors on the steps we should take as a country to achieve economic growth and development and to remove all obstacles that might impede the realisation of this goal', 'i am also pleased to announce that the international investment council has also been constituted except for three or four confirmations we are still expecting about which unfortunately i am not at liberty to give any further details', 'the following constitute the membership of the council  mr william rhodes vice president of the citigroup inc', 'of the united states  dr george soros chairperson of the soros fund management  mr frank savage

international investment council as well as their firm and unwavering confidence in our economy and our country', 'we look forward to working with them as the allweather friends of our country and people that they are', 'madame speaker and honourable members  the government is committed to the enhancement of the sound macroeconomic framework which is fundamental to the accomplishment of our economic goals', 'in this regard we have already announced that we will be setting inflation targets as one of the measures to ensure this sound framework', 'i hereby confirm that we will proceed with this issue as we have indicated', 'the honourable minister of finance will address this matter when he presents the budget in  days time', 'driven as we all are by the determination to ensure that our economy continues to expand and transform i am confident that all our social partners will work with us to achieve the purposes which informed the decision to set inflation targets', 'for some years now we have maintained the position that we will work continuously towards the removal of the foreign exchange controls we inherited from the apartheid regime', 'accordingly we have already removed all foreign exchange controls with regard to foreigners', 'the remaining controls therefore relate only to south africans', 'again the minister of finance will address this issue when he presents the budget on the rd of february', 'madame speaker  the government is concerned about our low savings ratio and the negative impact this has on our rate of investment', 'we have therefore constituted an interministerial group to work on this important issue', 'after the necessary interaction with our social partners and later this year the government will announce to parliament and the country the steps it proposes should be taken to address this matter', 'last june when we presented the state of the nation address we said that an area that had attracted considerable comment is the labour market and its actual or perceived impact on investment and job creation', '  we went on to say that the government will continue to give priority to the issue of job creation', 'if perceptions or realities influence the process negatively these must be addressed', '  consistent with these observations the honourable minister of labour has led a review of the labour market legislative framework', 'this has included interaction with our social partners at nedlac', 'as a result of this review the government has concluded that certain aspects of the legislative instruments aimed at giving effect to our labour market policies have led to unintended consequences', 'for this reason to ensure that we address simultaneously such issues as fair labour standards and the fostering of economic growth and job creation amendments to certain provisions of the labour relations act the basic conditions of employment act and the insolvency act will be introduced this year', 'the minister of labour will provide the details of the areas identified for legislative review', 'the government is also concerned to improve the level and effectiveness of investment by the government itself', 'this includes capital expenditures directed at encouraging the growth of small micro and medium enterprises', 'we have therefore carried out a comprehensive review of khula and ntsika to ensure that they discharge their responsibility to give financial and other support to small and medium business', 'this coupled with other measures should enable us to speed up the growth of this sector of our economy with a positive impact on employment creation among other things', 'work is also going on to address the issue of microlending especially as this relates to lending for productive economic purposes', 'this is especially relevant to the issue of the alleviation and elimination of poverty which continues to afflict millions of our people in both rural and urban areas', 'as part of the process of encouraging economic growth and development we have also established the local economic development fund to support municipalities as they work to meet their mandate of stimulating economic development at the local level', 'the fund has already started to make its disbursements thus helping to give hope and incomes to people who are unemployed in both urban and rural areas', 'improvements are also being effected with regard to our public works community programmes', 'these programmes will focus in particular on such infrastructure as rural roads which are of critical importance to the success of our rural development strategy to which we will refer later', 'our activities will also continue to focus on the important issue of the deracialisation of our economy and therefore the encouragement of black economic empowerment', 'the working group with black business will facilitate this process including the consideration of the reports prepared by the government and the black economic empowerment commission respectively', 'at the same time the government will continue with its work to improve our infrastructure', 'of particular importance in this regard will be the activities of such state corporations as transnet eskom telkom as well as the roads agency and the municipal infrastructure investment programme with regard to the expansion and the improvement of our transport electricity and telecommunications infrastructures', 'the programme for the restructuring of state assets is also being speeded up to address these objectives to increase the levels of investment and further to modernise the economy', 'during this year we will pay particular attention to the transnet group to continue the process of change represented by the acquisition of a valuable strategic partner by south african airways last year', 'of especial importance will be our capacity to ensure that the cost structure of our transport network is consistent with the high and sustained growth rates we have to achieve', 'consistent with the decisions taken at the jobs summit both the public and the private sectors have committed the necessary funds for the promotion of the tourism sector commonly accepted as potentially one of the most important sectors with regard to job creation', 'the work has therefore begun vigorously to promote the growth of this sector', 'we are certain this will produce the necessary beneficial results', 'while we were at davos i received a letter from professors nicholas conard and john parkington of the universities of tubingen and cape town respectively', 'they make the important observation that   the archaeological record of south africa including human fossils artefacts and organic remains has an international significance that extends far beyond the countrys borders', 'less well known are the hominids that demonstrate the earliest signs of modern people and the treasure trove of rock art sites', '  while correctly pointing to the need to protect this heritage to which we must surely respond they also indicate the potential for job creation in the preservation and other activities at the various archaeological sites', 'needless to say these can also be powerful tourist attractions thus emphasising the importance raised by the two professors with regard to the challenge of looking after what we have inherited which is as old as the origins of humanity', 'madame speaker and honourable members  as we have indicated would be done when we opened the new parliament last june the government has carried out extensive and intensive work to elaborate an integrated and sustainable rural development programme', 'the implementation of this programme will begin this year', 'the strategic objective we will pursue will be to ensure that we achieve integrated and sustainable development in our rural areas outside of and in addition to the commercial farms by the year ', 'we chose to focus on these areas to reverse a centuryold legacy of white minority rule according to which millions of our people were confined in povertystricken areas alternatively described as native reserves bantustans and homelands', 'the honourable deputy president and leader of government business will provide the details on this matter', 'last june i made specific reference to our commitment to deal with the relationship between poverty and crime', 'accordingly the government has been working to address the multifaceted crime and poverty challenges thrown up by the urban areas we identified', 'time will not allow us to detail the varied work that is being done in these areas', 'an opportunity will therefore have to be found in future to present that detailed report', 'at this stage suffice it for me to say that these areas of high population density will be at the centre of our urban renewal programme', 'this is particularly important in the light of the fact that in reality the urban areas contain the largest concentrations of poverty in our country', 'madame speaker  i would like to take this opportunity once more to emphasise the importance we attach to the strategic objective of building the partnership between the public and the private sectors', 'we will therefore further intensify our links and cooperation with the private sector for the successful implementation of the various economic initiatives we have mentioned', 'similarly we are very encouraged by the response of our people as a whole that we should transform ourselves into a nation at work', 'throughout the country from the wine farms in the western cape to rural communities in the northern province the people are responding to this call by taking the initiative to engage the challenge of productive economic activity', 'the government will work further to encourage its partnership with the people for development which will help to lay to rest the false notion that the government has the exclusive responsibility to create jobs and therefore that everybody should wait for the government to create these jobs', 'in this context we must warn very strongly that illegal and unjustified strikes such as the one recently experienced at volkswagen in uitenhage cannot be tolerated', 'jobs a better life for our people in the context of a growing economy and our standing in the eyes of the international investor community and the national investor community cannot be held hostage by elements pursuing selfish and antisocial purposes', 'accordingly the government has worked with the management at volkswagen as well as numsa to ensure that the problem created by some irresponsible elements at this plant is resolved', 'the government will not waver from this position', 'in this context i must also make this clear that the government is determined to carry out the programme for the renewal of our minibus taxi fleet as well as the introduction of other measures to ensure that this sector provides a safe dependable and disciplined service to the public', 'ageing minibuses which were designed as family vehicles cannot be allowed to roam our roads condemning paying passengers to risk their lives by travelling in mobile coffins', 'as some of our provincial governments demonstrated when they closed down taxi ranks to deal with the continuing problem of taxi violence and while we are ready to engage in genuine consultations it is a mistake to think that the government can be intimidated into taking wrong decisions', 'here we would also like to make the point that low tax morality has led to an increase in tax criminality', 'the revenue service will therefore introduce new measures which will result in tough action against noncompliant tax payers who defraud the fiscus of millions of rand through vat and customs fraud tax evasion or not registering for tax at all', 'tax criminality feeds other forms of criminality and will also not be tolerated', 'madame speaker  we are certain that the combination of the various economic initiatives and processes we have mentioned including the continuing implementation of all the commitments made at the job summit will take us further forward as we address the ever urgent questions of economic growth development job creation and poverty reduction', 'in this regard we must also mention our hope that the european union will overcome the problems that have arisen within its ranks which have affected the unhindered implementation of the trade and development agreement which was concluded between ourselves and the eu', 'similarly we continue to work hard to conclude the matters relating largely to the issue of rules of origin which have delayed the implementation of the sadc trade protocol', 'we remain convinced that this protocol will come into force during the first half of this year signifying a critically important step forward towards the transformation of our region into a common economic area', 'at the same time we will continue purposefully and systematically to increase our economic relations with countries of the south for the mutual benefit including nigeria saudi arabia brazil india malaysia and china', 'as the honourable members are aware all these matters are of great importance to the success of our economy and will therefore receive the necessary attention', 'also receiving similar attention is the problem represented by the fact that we still have not removed the bottlenecks which result in a slow disbursement of funds allocated for poverty relief', 'the government has determined that this is unacceptable while recognising that it reflects the fact that we have not yet completed the work of the fundamental restructuring of our system of governance', 'these poverty relief funds represent an important part of our social expenditure which continues to be focused on meeting the social needs of the most disadvantaged in our society', 'the government will continue to allocate significant resources to address these needs as best we can', 'we will therefore continue with our programmes to address such matters as pensions and social welfare housing education and medical care', 'at the same time we are working towards the creation of an integrated social security system further to improve the quality of our social spending and to enhance its positive impact on those in our society who are most in need', 'it is however also clear that we need to strike the proper balance between such expenditure and more directly economic expenditure by the public sector to ensure that we address the challenges of growth and redistribution together', 'this also is being attended to', 'later this year at the beginning of july our country will host the th international aids conference', 'this will help further to focus our attention on this important challenge', 'as we announced when we spoke at the ncop last year the honourable minister of health continues to address the complex questions which relate to the issue of aids', 'what seems to be clear as of now is that in addition to the work that is being done and which must be intensified regarding the sexual behaviour of our people and the use of condoms all possible interventions will have to be made to deal with the challenges of poverty and malnutrition a whole range of well known diseases such as tuberculosis malaria hepatitis and others as well as the development of the required vaccines', 'it is necessary that we further strengthen our partnerships against aids to ensure that the antiaids message reaches all our people', 'i would also like to take this opportunity to wish the national aids council success in its work', 'madame speaker  of great importance to our successful development is the matter of human resource development', 'both the skills levy and the umsobomvu fund will be used to help us to deal with this matter', 'the tirisano programme launched by the honourable minister of education also constitutes an important plank in our offensive to ensure that we develop the necessary levels of education and training', 'in particular this year we will pay special attention to the improvement of the quality of the management of our schools with the intention to ensure that we really reinculcate the culture of learning teaching and discipline throughout our school system', 'two days ago i had the privilege to participate at the celebration of the success achieved by a group of soweto high school students who obtained their matriculation exemptions', 'what was remarkable about this group is that both their parents and their teachers had given them up because of their involvement in crime and other deviant behaviour', 'nevertheless two outstanding south africans mrs jacky maarohanye who participated in the soweto uprising of  and dr t', 'w', 'kambule an old and distinguished teacher and principal now aged  decided to act as parent and teacher to these young people', 'through the work of their ithuteng trust we now have   soweto youth who not only study hard but also carry out important voluntary community work including educating their peers to turn against crime against rape and against drug abuse', 'we have to inspire all our schools to emulate the example of the ithuteng trust which can truly be described as an outstanding example of the south african miracle', 'madame speaker  when we addressed parliament at the end of june last year we made a commitment to step up the fight against crime', 'this we have done and will continue further to intensify our offensive', 'among other things this involves the restructuring and revamping of our entire criminal justice system', 'this work is also proceeding apace and includes the improvement of our capacity effectively to deal with the crimes of rape and the abuse of women children and the disabled', 'similarly we will not relax our efforts to root out corruption in our society with special focus on the public sector', 'the honourable ministers heading the criminal justice system including the ministers of home affairs and defence will have occasion to report on the important work they are doing severally and collectively within the context of our national crime prevention strategy', 'we are still faced with the task of completing the process of the restructuring of the machinery of government', 'among the objectives we are pursuing are   the raising of the skills levels within the public sector and retaining professional personnel    improving management financial accountability and service delivery    combating corruption and the abuse of public resources    enhancing the motivation of all public sector workers to serve our people and   increasing the proportion of public funds spent on investment', 'additional steps will therefore be taken this year to ensure the rightsizing of our public service', 'madame speaker  this year we will be holding our second local government elections', 'we are confident that once again we will all work together to ensure that these elections are held in conditions of peace and peaceful political competition and that they are free and fair', 'we will appeal once more to members of the public service and our population at large to volunteer their services to assist the independent electoral commission to carry out its tasks as effectively as it accomplished the task of organising and conducting the last general election', 'i am also convinced that we will also succeed to remove the misconceptions that have arisen with regard to the local government demarcation process', 'this relates in particular to issues relating to communal areas and the constitutionally guaranteed place and role of the traditional leaders and the traditional institutions of government', 'once again i would like to assure our traditional leaders whose representatives around our country i will see during the coming weeks that the demarcation process bears no relationship whatsoever to and has no negative impact on their role and powers', 'accordingly we will still rely on them to continue to mobilise the people they represent to participate in the processes of the further entrenchment of democracy and the enhancement of development in the rural areas', 'madame speaker and honourable members  when we spoke from this podium at the millennium debate last year we urged that we should use this year to prepare for the launch of the african century', 'specifically we said that   we should devote the year  that is upon us to do everything that needs to be done to ensure that by its end we see our entire continent at the ready to join in a powerful movement of the peoples of africa for the realisation of africas century', '  the government is committed to this goal and will do everything it can to ensure that it is realised', 'we also call on all our people in their various formations to respond to our call', 'the government pledges its full support both to nelson mandela and sir ketumile masire of botswana as they work with the governments and people of burundi and the democratic republic of congo to bring peace and democracy to these sister african countries', 'i would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate our honourable minister of trade and industry for the work he has done in the last three years as president of the united nations conference on trade and development an international post he will relinquish soon', 'many around the world including our own people will continue to rely on the honourable minister of trade and industry to defend the interests of the poor of the world within the forthcoming world trade organisation negotiations', 'we will ourselves continue to do our best to discharge our responsibilities as current chairperson of both the nonaligned movement and the commonwealth', 'as much as the rest of the world stood with us as we fought to end the system of apartheid which struggle brought about the announcements that were made from this rostrum as the apartheid parliament opened  years ago so do we have an obligation ourselves to contribute to the construction of a better world for all humanity', 'from this we cannot walk away', 'we should aim to make a meaningful contribution in this regard because with regard to all the important objectives we have to pursue at no point during our entire history have we ever been as well placed as we are today to meet the challenges that confront us', 'our national soccer team bafana bafana is in west africa participating in the african cup of nations tournament', 'we wish them well in their campaign convinced that once more they will return with the africa cup', 'at the same time it is clear that fairness and the development of soccer this most popular world sport demand that for the first time in the year  the soccer world cup competition should take place in africa', 'for these purposes there can be no better venue than the land of human hope that has all the necessary facilities which our country is', 'one among us who sits on the back benches of the majority party has composed a freedom lament and song', 'in his lament he says of the men and women that constitute humanity that   they are of spirit which is like the wind mind them when you touch them when you hurt them when you kill them when you are unkind to them when you are cruel to them mind them they will live in you and you in them like a story which does not end', '  it is out of these noble feelings that our own new world will be born whose sighting perhaps at a distance has inspired the spirit of hope which reigns so confidently in all corners of our beautiful land', 'his name is mongane wally serote poet patriot and member of parliament', 'i thank you for your attention']"

a result of which our people gave us the overwhelming authority to govern our country from  until the next elections in   with your indulgence i would like to step further back and recall what we said in  as representatives of our people in the presence of our friends from the rest of the world convened at our seat of government the union buildings in tshwane on freedom day the th anniversary of our liberation and participated in the inauguration of the president of the republic whom our parliament had chosen respecting the will of the people democratically demonstrated during the

was to inherit a lifelong curse', 'it was a place in which to be born white was to carry a permanent burden of fear and hidden rage  it was a place in which squalor the stench of poverty the open sewers the decaying rot the milling crowds of wretchedness the unending images of a landscape strewn with carelessly abandoned refuse assumed an aspect that seemed necessary to enhance the beauty of another world of tidy streets and wooded lanes and flowers blossoms offsetting the green and singing grass and birds and houses fit for kings and queens and lyrical music and love', 'it was a place in which to live in some places was to invite others to prey on you or to condemn oneself to prey on others guaranteed neighbours who could not but fall victim to alcohol and drug stupors that would dull the pain of living who knew that their lives would not be normal without murder in their midst and rape and brutal personal wars without a cause', 'it was a place in which to live in other neighbourhoods was to enjoy safety and security because to be safe was to be protected by high walls electrified fences guard dogs police patrols and military regiments ready to defend those who were our masters with guns and tanks and aircraft that would rain death on those who would disturb the peace of the masters  we have gathered here today on freedom day because in time our people together with the billions of human beings across the globe who are our comradesinarms and whom our distinguished guests represent decided to say  an end to all that   we are greatly encouraged that our general elections of a fortnight ago confirmed the determination of all our people regardless of race colour and ethnicity to work together to build a south africa defined by a common dream  none of

improvement of the health of our people to reducing the levels of crime raising the levels of literacy and numeracy and opening the doors of learning and culture to all  we pledge to all the heroes and heroines who sacrificed for our freedom as well as to you our friends from the rest of the world that we will never betray the trust you bestowed on us when you helped to give us the possibility to transform south africa into a democratic peaceful nonracial nonsexist and prosperous country committed to the noble vision of human solidarity', 'the work to create that south africa has begun', 'that work will continue during our second decade of freedom', '  fifty years before as they prepared to convene the congress of the people which adopted the freedom charter the patriots of the day had said let us speak together all of us together  african and european indian and coloured  all the people of south africa let us speak together of freedom', 'and of the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free', 'we must today renew our pledge to speak together of freedom to act in partnership to realise the happiness for all that should come with liberty to work together to build a south africa defined by a common dream to say together in action  enough of everything that made our country to contain within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society  we must continue to respond to the perspective we spoke of as the present government began its term of office fully conscious that none of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty and therefore that the struggle to eradicate poverty has been and will continue to be a central part of the national effort to build the new south africa', 'responding to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the south africa defined by a common dream our

our country    to promote the growth of the small and medium business sector    to speed up the process of skills development    to improve our export performance focussing on services and manufactured goods    to increase spending on scientific research and development    to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the second economy    to implement programmes to

demand reflects a healthy growth in levels of prosperity across the population  and the major infrastructure projects that we are embarking on demand massive input of supplies and machinery', 'but our international trade balance shows that we have not succeeded in building the capacity to produce the consumer and capital goods that our country needs', 'while household debt has increased broadly at the same rate as growth in income the fact that south africans are saving less means that we have to depend on savings from other nations', 'the continuing occasional volatility of our currency has

and business opportunities', 'the housing programme has seen close to   new subsidies allocated in the past two years', 'however as we sought to improve quality and develop plans for those who are being missed by the public and private sector programmes currently under way the pace of rollout has been much slower than we expected', 'we must act to change this situation', 'as honourable members are aware we have over the past few years developed and started implementing various programmes aimed at improving passenger transport', 'these include the taxi recapitalisation programme and provincial initiatives such as the moloto rail corridor in mpumalanga around which feasibility work has started the klipfontein corridor in cape town and the gautrain project with its linkages to the rest of the public transport system', 'these and many other initiatives form part of a comprehensive passenger transport strategy combining both road and rail', 'we will attend to the urgent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people', 'access to electricity water and sanitation has improved', 'by  south africa had already achieved the millennium development goal in respect of basic water supply with improvement of access from  in  to  in ', 'according to the united nations development programme undp south africa is one of the few countries that spend less on military budgets than on water and sanitation', 'in the words of the undp human development report of    south africa has demonstrated how the human right to water can serve as a mechanism for empowerment and a guide to policy rightsbased water reform has enabled it to expand access and overcome the legacy of racial inequality inherited from apartheid partly through rightsbased entitlements', 'pp  we should indeed celebrate this great achievement', 'but it is a fact that  million people are still without potable water', 'many more are without electricity and sanitation', 'we are proud that within one year we have been able to reduce the backlog in the eradication of the bucket system in established settlements by almost half', 'we are on course to put an end to this dehumanising system in these areas by the end of this year', 'we will continue to confront these challenges so as to erase in our country that which is ugly and repulsive so that together we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty', 'an examination of education and skills acquisition shows improvement of quite a high base by  though at a slow pace', 'this applies to literacy levels gross school enrolment and tertiary participation rates', 'the fluctuating matric pass rates do indicate that much more needs to be done to stabilise the system and ensure steady improvement', 'at the same time the number of matric students who pass mathematics at the higher grade is only slightly better than in ', 'we also continue to show weaknesses in implementing the adult basic education programme', 'while the land restitution programme has resulted in more settlements in the recent period we still need to put in extra effort in dealing with remaining cases many of which are much more complex', 'on the other hand very little progress has been made in terms of land redistribution', 'we will undertake a careful review of the inhibiting factors so that this programme is urgently speeded up', 'all these economic and social programmes form part of our strategies to reduce and eradicate the poverty that continues to afflict many of our people', 'the work done during the course of last year by women through the south african women in dialogue working with various government departments including a visit to countries such as tunisia and chile where great progress has been made in dealing with poverty does point to some defects in our systems in this regard', 'from the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other things   define clearly the poverty matrix of our country    develop a proper database of households living in poverty    identify and implement specific interventions relevant to these households    monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty    in this context address all indigence especially the high numbers of women so affected    coordinate and align all antipoverty programmes to maximise impact and avoid wastage and duplication  and   accelerate the training of family social workers at professional and auxiliary levels to ensure that identified households are properly supported and monitored', 'this will ensure the systematic linkage of beneficiaries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities continuously focused on the task to ensure that as many of our people as possible graduate out of dependence on social grants and enter the labour market', 'in the meantime we will continue to explore new initiatives which will progressively improve the social wage', 'a critical leg of these social interventions should be the intensification of joint efforts among all south africans to improve social cohesion', 'in this year of the th anniversary of the doctors pact of leaders of african and indian communities ab xuma gm naicker and yusuf dadoo the th anniversary of the murder of steve biko and the th anniversary of the visit to dakar by afrikaner intellectuals to meet the anc the issue of our variety of identities and the overarching sense of belonging to south africa needs to be better canvassed across society in a manner that strengthens our unity as a nation', 'further on this the th anniversary of the banning of the world and the weekend world newspapers we are dutybound to ask the question  have we all fully internalised our responsibility in building social cohesion and promoting a common sense of belonging reinforcing the glue that holds our nation together  in other words measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone', 'we must together as south africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay and work to attain the happiness that comes with it', 'madame speaker and chairperson   i am certain that we shall all agree that working together to achieve the happiness that comes with freedom applies equally to the challenge of dealing with crime', 'in the  rdp white paper we said  promoting peace and security will involve all people', 'it will build on and expand the national drive for peace and combat the endemic violence faced by communitieswith special attention to the various forms of violence to which women are subjected  peace and political stability are also central to the governments efforts to create an enabling environment to encourage investmentdecisive action will be taken to eradicate lawlessness drug trafficking gun running crime and especially the abuse of women and children', '  certainly we cannot erase that which is ugly and repulsive and claim the happiness that comes with freedom if communities live in fear closeted behind walls and barbed wire ever anxious in their houses on the streets and on our roads unable freely to enjoy our public spaces', 'obviously we must continue and further intensify the struggle against crime', 'while we have already surpassed that targeted figure of   police officers employed in the south african police service and while we have improved the training programme we recognise the fact that the impact of this is not yet high enough for everybody to feel a better sense of safety and security', 'while we have reduced the incidence of most contact crimes the annual reduction rate with regard to such categories as robbery assault and murder is still below the  that we had targeted', 'and the abuse of women and children continues at an unacceptable level', 'the increase in the incidence of particular crimes during the security workers strike should have brought home to all of us the fact that the security industry cannot be handled simply as a private affair of the private sector', 'quite clearly the regulatory system that we have in place is inadequate', 'this applies to such issues as wage levels personnel vetting systems enforcement of guidelines on cashdelivery vehicles and so on', 'this is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year so that in addition to improving the work of the police we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security expectations of the public in which huge resources are expended are actually met', 'we will also continue to put more effort into improving the functioning of our courts to increase the rate of reduction in case backlogs', 'and we will ensure that decisions to expand the correctional services infrastructure improve the management of border control as well as the immigration and documentation services among others are implemented', 'many of the weaknesses in improving services to the population derive in part from inadequate capacity and systems to monitor implementation', 'as such in the period leading up to  the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our agenda', 'what has emerged among others as a critical area for strategic intervention is the content of training that public servants receive in various institutions and the role of the sa management development institute samdi which in actual fact should be the major service provider including in the mass induction of public servants', 'compliance levels within departments in relation to public service and finance management legislation have been somewhat mixed', 'obviously this cannot be allowed to continue even if we take into account the correct observation that auditing requirements at national and provincial levels have become more stringent', 'in this regard the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management is crucial', 'programmes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue apace', 'immediately after the march  local government elections induction programmes were conducted taking into account that  of the mayors are new', 'what is of concern though is that in many of these municipalities many vacancies remain or have emerged in senior management and the professions', 'for instance in september last year  of municipalities did not have municipal managers  in the northwest province the vacancy rate at senior management level was over   and in mpumalanga only  of senior managers had concluded key performance agreements', 'we continue to respond to these challenges and will undertake all necessary tasks informed by our five year local government strategic agenda which includes handson assistance to municipalities by national and provincial structures the deployment of skilled personnel including professional volunteers from the public and strengthening the ward committees   of which have been established across the country', 'the programme to align planning instruments across the spheres of government that is the national spatial development perspective provincial growth and development strategies and integrated development plans is continuing with pilot projects for complete alignment being run in  of our districts and metros', 'these pilot projects should be completed by the end of this year', 'it is a matter of proud record that over half of the districts and metros have held their growth and development summits and the rest intend to complete this process by the end of february', 'this will lay the basis for cooperation among all social partners in speeding up local economic development', 'honourable members   i would like to take advantage of this occasion to express my gratitude to deputy president phumzile mlambongcuka for the inspiring leadership she has given to the implementation of the accelerated and shared growth initiative asgisa working with the ministers and premiers who constitute the task team concretely addressing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure higher rates of investment and labourabsorption as well as matters pertaining to skills development and the efficiency of the state system', 'we highly appreciate the contribution of all members of the executive and our public service managers across the three spheres of government in leading this process and in implementing the government programme as a whole', 'this is central to our efforts to erase that which is ugly and repulsive in our society so that we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty', 'in this regard in order further to speed up the implementation of asgisa over and above the multiyear programmes announced in the recent past government will this year   complete the process of reviewing the countrys experience in the articulation among such macroeconomic indicators as the exchange rate inflation and interest rates so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industries which produce tradables for both the domestic and export markets and have the potential to absorb large pools of semiskilled workers    in line with the national industrial policy framework which has now been completed we will   intensify implementation of customised sector measures to facilitate investments in business process outsourcing tourism biofuels and chemicals and finalise practical programmes for forestry and paper clothing and textiles metals and engineering    develop an overarching strategy to prioritise key interventions in mining and mineral beneficiation agriculture and agroprocessing the white goods sector creative industries community and social services and pharmaceuticals', 'this must include a determined drive to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods', 'with regard to mineral beneficiation for instance we will set up a state diamond trader that will purchase  of diamonds from local producers and sell them to local cutters and producers', 'we are happy that debeers has agreed to assist free of charge with management technical skills and asset provision for a period of three years    develop programmes to facilitate investments in sectors along the supply chain for our infrastructure programmes including capital goods in ict transport and energy with regard to energy we will also expedite our work to ensure greater reliance on nuclear power generation natural gas and the various forms of renewable sources of energy', 'with regard to communications i am pleased to announce that the department of communications together with the mobile telephone companies and telkom are finalising plans to address call termination rates this year for the benefit of all consumers', 'in addition telkom will apply a special low rate for international bandwidth to  development call centres each employing  persons as part of the effort to expand the bpo sector', 'these centres will be established in areas identified by government', 'the special rate will be directly comparable to those for the same service and capacity per month offered in any of the comparable countries', ' we will also take a variety of steps to improve competition in the economy among others to lower the cost of doing business and promote investment including practical introduction of the regulatory impact assessment ria system developing highspeed national and international broadband capacity finalising the plan to improve the capacity of the rail and port operators and strengthening the effectiveness of our competition authorities', 'the progress we have made with regard to the recapitalisation of further education and training fet colleges has created the possibility for us significantly to expand the number of available artisans', 'starting this year resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to trainees in need who enter these institutions', 'at the same time we shall urgently resolve the issue of responsibilities between the national and provincial spheres in the management of the fet system', 'we do hope that our efforts to promote this area of opportunity will help send the message especially to our young people that artisan skills are as critical for economic growth as other levels of qualification', 'after intense interaction between government and leaders of our universities agreement has been reached and decisions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in short supply are provided', 'in this regard we wish to commend the role played by the joint initiative on skills acquisition jipsa which brings together government business labour training institutes and others', 'as the honourable members know we have also significantly increased the number of nonfee paying schools', 'in carrying out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be informed by our commitment to ensure that the  fifa world cup is the best ever', 'we wish in this regard to congratulate our local organising committee loc and other partners for the sterling work they are doing', 'quite clearly in order to ensure that all south africans enjoy the happiness that comes with a growing economy these and other measures will need to be accompanied by an intensified programme to address challenges in the second economy', 'because of this during the course of this year we will among other things   take further practical action to improve access to microfinance including the reach of the apex fund samaf and the agricultural microcredit fund mafisa    ensure the proper functioning of the small enterprises development agency seda    process the companies bill adopted for public comment by cabinet last wednesday as part of the battery of measures to reduce the regulatory burden on small medium and microenterprises and to empower minority shareholders and employees    having surpassed the   target we set ourselves we will increase the number of young people engaged in the national youth service by at least   through  of our departments which have already developed plans in this regard enrol   young volunteers in community development initiatives and employ   young people as part of the expanded public works programme in the maintenance of government buildings    intensify efforts to integrate youth development into the mainstream of government work including a youth cooperatives programme and the ongoing efforts to link unemployed graduates with employment opportunities  and in this regard we wish to thank the many companies public and private big and small which have responded in a splendid and practical manner to this initiative  and   start implementing the communal land rights act in order to improve economic utilisation of communal land while at the same time expanding assistance such as irrigation seeds and implements to small and cooperative farmers', 'honourable members   the economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concerted drive in which all of south africa should engage in order to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality in our society', 'for us it is not a mere clich to assert that the success of our democracy should and will be measured by the concrete steps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable in our society', 'in order to improve on the social programmes that we have implemented over the years we aim this year to complete the work already started to reform our system of social security so that phased implementation can start as early as possible', 'a critical part of this reform will be the task of repairing a defect identified in the  report of the committee of inquiry into a comprehensive system of social security in south africa', 'this is that the contributory earningsrelated pillar of our social security system is missing or unreliable for large numbers of working people', 'the principle guiding this approach is that over and above social assistance provided through the government budget we need to explore the introduction of an earningsrelated contributory social security system that is informed by the principle of social solidarity', 'this will mean that all south africans will enjoy membership of a common administratively efficient social insurance system while those earning higher incomes will be able to continue contributing to private retirement and insurance schemes', 'in the discussions thus far conducted within government consensus is emerging that elements of this system would need to include   continuation of the minimum benefits contained in our social grants system with the benefits paid through a modern administrative system    a wage subsidy for lowwage employees possibly directed at first entrants into the job market especially young people  and   a social security tax to finance basic retirement savings death disability and unemployment benefits', 'the minister of finance will further elaborate on these issues in the budget speech', 'what we should underline though is that in finishing the new social security dispensation government will undertake a comprehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individually and through nedlac', 'in addition we have also started examining measures to reach vulnerable children over the age of  years', 'our programme in the social sector for this year will also include   speeding up of the construction of lowcost housing which will require the urgent establishment of a special purpose vehicle to handle finances piloting of the land use management bill and ensuring that the remaining elements of the muchdelayed agreement with the private sector on lowcost housing are finalised    speeding up the implementation of the taxi recapitalisation project implementing detailed plans for passenger rail and road transport including the bus rapid transit system in the metros and recapitalisation of metrorail and in this regard let me take this opportunity to emphasise that government and our partners in santaco will not be bullied into abandoning the taxi recapitalisation project and any attempts to undermine public order in pursuit of selfish interests will be dealt with accordingly    expanding access to early childhood development both as part of the programme to improve the general education system and as part of the expanded public works programme    expanding training and employment of nurses and social workers as well as auxiliaries increasing the number of training institutions improving the quality of training and instituting a bursary system    continuing with the implementation of the remuneration dispensation for medical professionals and providing additional resources further to improve the remuneration levels of teachers    ensuring the implementation without further delay of measures to reduce the cost of medicines  and   continuing work to address especially the various nonnatural causes of death in our society as well as lifestyle diseases malaria the various strains of tb road accidents and violent crime', 'in this regard government commits itself to intensify the campaign against hiv and aids and to improve its implementation of all elements of the comprehensive approach such as prevention homebased care and treatment', 'we shall ensure that the partnerships built over the years are strengthened and that our improved national comprehensive strategy against aids and sexually transmitted infections is finalised as soon as possible', 'this year we shall complete concrete plans on implementation of the final stages of our programmes to meet the targets for universal access to water in  sanitation in  and electricity in ', 'we shall also finalise the strategy and programmes to address matters of social cohesion including the comprehensive and integrated antipoverty strategy we have mentioned as well as address issues pertaining to national unity value systems and identity', 'all these efforts madame speaker and chairperson must go hand in hand with a sustained drive to improve community safety and security', 'in this regard government will ensure that the decisions already taken about strengthening our fight against crime are effectively implemented', 'the challenge that we face in addressing this issue has little to do with policies', 'rather what is required is effective organisation mobilisation and leadership of the mass of lawenforcement intelligence and corrections officers and functionaries of the justice system', 'the overwhelming majority of these public servants have proven over and over again in actual practice that they are prepared to put their lives on the line and to sacrifice even the little quality time they could have with their families in defence of our freedom and our security', 'in addition to the many ongoing programmes that we have been implementing government will this year   continue to improve the remuneration and working conditions of the police and start the process of further expanding the personnel of the south african police service to bring their total number to over   within three years and ensure optimal utilisation of the electronic monitoring and evaluation system that has just been introduced    bring to full capacity the forensic laboratories which have been equipped with the latest technology and ensure the optimum utilisation of the fingerprint database  indeed many of the recent successes in solving serious crime incidents have been facilitated by these systems    bring the operations of the department of home affairs to full capacity by filling vacant posts improving systems and implementing other recommendations of the task team that has been working with the minister to improve the work of this vital institution    implement the recommendations of the khampepe commission on the mandate and operations of the directorate of special operations scorpions    start the process of further modernising the systems of the south african revenue services especially in respect of border control and improve the work of the interdepartmental coordinating structures in this regard    intensify intelligence work with regard to organised crime building on the successes that have been achieved in the last few months in dealing with cashintransit heists drug trafficking and poaching of game and abalone    utilise to maximum effect the new technology that has been provided to the justice system and generally improve management of the courts and the prosecution service in order massively to reduce case backlogs    finalise remaining elements of measures to transform the judiciary and improve its functioning in consultation with this eminent institution of our democracy    implement the programmes decided upon to build more corrections facilities and realise the objectives of the white paper on corrections    continue with the processes further to capacitate our intelligence agencies and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our constitution and laws  and   improve our analysis of crime trends to improve our performance with regard both to crime prevention and crime combating', 'in this regard we must respond to the cold reality that as in other countries the overwhelming majority of violent crimes against the person occur in the most socioeconomically deprived areas of our country and require strong and sustained community interventions focused on crime prevention', 'as we have already said these and other measures will succeed only if we build an enduring partnership in actual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police to make life more and more difficult for the criminals', 'in this regard we are heartened by the resolve shown by leaders of the business and religious communities further to strengthen such partnerships on the ground and to give of their time and resources to strengthen the fight against crime', 'government will play its part to ensure that these partnerships actually work and that we all act together to discharge the responsibility to protect our citizens', 'i should mention in this regard that the ministry of safety and security and the police service are working on proposals further to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the vitally important community police forums', 'madame speaker and chairperson   further to improve its service to the people government should optimise its capacity and organisational efficiency', 'to achieve these objectives we will during the course of this year   strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity across all the spheres including training of managers responsible for the implementation of this system    complete within the next  months legislation on a single public service and relevant norms and standards remuneration policy and matters pertaining to medical aid and pensions    intensify outreach and awareness on issues of national spatial development while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the harmonisation of planning instruments across the three spheres    conduct capacity assessments and implement interventions in provincial departments responsible for local government as well as the offices of the premiers while

and set up more multipurpose community centres beyond the  currently operational  and   further capacitate and provide more support to the institution of traditional leadership', 'improving governance also means having a sound statistical database about social dynamics within our nation', 'in this regard two major surveys will be undertaken in ', 'as of two days ago   field workers from statistics south africa have gone out across our country to collect information on   households chosen to participate in a community survey which will give government as accurate as possible a snapshot of the circumstances of citizens in every part of the country', 'in october another   individuals in   households will be selected to participate in south africas first national panel study the national income dynamics study', 'these   individuals will be tracked over time to further our understanding of such issues such as migration labour market transitions intergenerational mobility and household formation and dissolution', 'i wish to take this opportunity to call on all those selected to cooperate fully in these important undertakings', 'madame speaker and chairperson  among the greatest achievements of the peoples of africa in the past twoandhalf years has been the restoration of peace in the great lakes region', 'we are proud as south africans of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about  from the young men and women in our national defence force to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the african dream finds practical realisation in the homeland of patrice lumumba', 'we will continue to work with the sister people of the drc as well as burundi the comoros and sudan in particular to ensure that the condition of peace and stability thus far attained translates without pause into concerted action for economic reconstruction and social development', 'however while we are fully justified in celebrating the achievements that africa has made in her endeavour to achieve peace and development we cannot underplay the challenges that we face in dealing with the remaining areas of conflict particularly the general peace process in sudan including the situation in darfur cte divoire and somalia', 'our government will respond appropriately and as our capacity permits to the call of the african union for assistance to the people and government of somalia', 'critical in this regard are the initiatives under way to ensure that the protagonists within somalia interact with one another to find a solution that is inclusive and practicable based on the need to achieve national reconciliation', 'this year the african peer review forum will complete its review of our country', 'i wish to take this opportunity to thank our legislators government ministers and departments our civil society organisations and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challenging as it was unique for our young democracy', 'we will also take the necessary steps to implement the required programme of action that will emerge as a result of the peer review process', 'similarly we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to speed up the implementation of the nepad programmes', 'just over a month ago south africa started its tour of duty as a nonpermanent member of the united nations security council', 'we hereby wish to pledge on behalf of the people of south africa that we will in this most esteemed of multilateral bodies do everything necessary further to contribute to international peace and security', 'in this regard we will also continue to engage the leaders of the peoples of palestine israel iraq iran and other countries in the middle east and the persian gulf', 'we shall also continue to strengthen our relations with other countries on the continent our partners in india brazil and the peoples republic of china other countries of the south as well as japan europe and north america', 'one of the critical questions that we shall pursue in this regard is the speedy resumption of the doha development round of wto negotiations', 'we are convinced that solutions to the logjams currently being experienced can be found and that it is in the longterm interest of developed and developing countries alike that these talks should reach fruition', 'madame speaker chairperson and honourable members   since the popular mandate of  we have made welcome progress in further changing south africa for the better', 'we should not and do not underplay the many difficulties we still confront', 'but the message that our collective experience communicates to all of us is that working together we can and shall succeed in meeting the common objective we have set ourselves as a nation  to build a better life for all in a country that no longer contains within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society', 'we should today even more confidently speak together of freedom', 'we should dare to act in concert to pursue the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free', 'we are not there yet', 'but no one except ourselves shall ensure that this dream is realised', 'and so let us roll up our sleeves and get down to work fully understanding that the task to build the south africa for which we yearn is a common responsibility we all share', 'thank you']"

position we were in in  and despite a very volatile international environment', 'furthermore the international competitiveness of the economy has fundamentally improved', 'the threat of deindustrialisation and economic collapse as a result of manufacturing sector inefficiency which we inherited has been addressed through tariff and industrial reforms', 'however the reality remains that our rate of growth is still too low as are the aggregate savings and investment rates', 'similarly the levels of poverty unemployment and underdevelopment in some parts of our country are too high', 'while continuing to focus on the maintenance of the correct macroeconomic balances we have therefore decided to pay detailed attention to the critical microeconomic issues', 'in particular we

country faces', 'the objectives we seek to achieve are moving the economy onto a highgrowth path increasing its competitiveness and efficiency raising employment levels and reducing poverty and persistent inequalities', 'to improve our competitiveness we must lower input costs throughout the economy', 'accordingly we have decided to go over to a managed liberalisation of the energy transport and telecommunications sectors', 'with regard to all these sectors all outstanding policy matters including the regulatory frameworks will be addressed leading to the creation of the necessary climate of certainty for both public and private sector investors', 'with regard to the energy sector among other things our decision will entail restructuring the electricity supply and distribution industries to introduce greater levels of competition', 'independent power producers will be allowed into our energy system and localised energy grids for rural areas will be developed', 'a gas bill will be tabled in parliament and gas from mozambique in the first instance will provide a new energy source for industry and domestic consumers', 'in the transport sector among other things new

investments will be made in this sector', 'the application of modern communication and information technology in the fields of education health commerce and government will be expedited', 'as we have said this year a greater degree of certainty will be reached with respect to the policy and regulatory regime of the telecommunications sector', 'because of the critical importance of this sector we will also establish two bodies to assist the government as it works further to ensure that we do not fall further behind the rest of the world as a result of the digital divide', 'the first of these will be a presidential national commission on information society and development', 'this will be constituted from representatives of our countrys public and private sectors', 'the second will be a presidential international task force on information society and development', 'ceos from major international corporations and experts active in the field of information and communication technology

additional names in the near future', 'we have identified other sectors of our economy that require special attention because of their potential to contribute especially to the objectives of higher growth rates and job creation', 'these include agriculture tourism certain export sectors cultural industries and the information and communication sector', 'the specific export sectors we are referring to are agroprocessing automobiles and components mining technology and minerals beneficiation and clothing and textiles', 'in addition to lowering input costs and improving competitiveness these sectors will be stimulated through specific policy and regulatory actions that will be effected this year', 'while not detracting from the states ongoing efforts to maintain and sustain other sectors of the economy different and additional actions will be taken this year to reinforce the growth of the sectors we have mentioned', 'we may perhaps mention some specifics relating to tourism to illustrate the kind of attention the government will give to the identified sectors', 'the business trust has already announced its decision to help create  new blackowned tourism enterprises', 'this year the government and the trust will fund  learnerships in this sector', 'major public sector investments have already been made in the lubombo sdi and money will also be put into the wild coast sdi including the rerouting and maintenance of the n', 'space has been and will be created for the private sector to invest in these and other sdis continuing our effort to build publicprivatesector

which we will host next year and which will bring an estimated   people to our country', 'we must also report that the publicprivate sector international marketing council has already begun its work', 'we are certain that it will assist greatly to build a positive image for our country based on a more accurate and objective understanding of the advances we are making and the better future we are building for ourselves', 'we have also taken the necessary decisions with regard to the improvement of the conditions that underpin and constitute the enabling framework for economic efficiency and competitiveness', 'i refer here to human resource development technology the economic infrastructure and access to capital', 'honourable members will agree that welcome progress is being made in the efforts to improve the quality of education including the provision of infrastructure consolidating the culture of learning and teaching and introducing adult basic education', 'however much more needs to be done to improve our skills base', 'in this regard government has approved a human resource development strategy that will enable us to launch an accelerated skills development programme for those areas that are critical to a more competitive economy', 'immigration laws and procedures will be reviewed urgently to enable us to attract skills into our country', 'improvements in maths and science education will also be prioritised', 'we recognise the fact that competitiveness is driven by technological advances and innovation', 'in recognition of this investment in research and development is one of the focal points of our integrated plan aimed at attaining a cutting edge in key areas such as biotechnology', 'at the same time we will continue with the consultations aimed at reforming the labour market as well as investigations into the feasibility of reducing the cost of labour without reducing workers wages', 'investment in the economic infrastructure will be prioritised to support the highgrowth areas the integrated rural development strategy and the urban renewal programme', 'an additional r billion has been set aside for this purpose over the next three years', 'the government remains concerned that access to capital which is key to economic growth and the development of the small and medium enterprise sector in the economy remains difficult for the majority', 'we need to develop the capacity to make such access easier while retaining a well managed financial sector', 'accordingly the regulation of the financial services sector will be reviewed this year', 'new partnerships with financial institutions will be explored and the microfinance sector will be mobilised in support of entrepreneurship and productive activities', 'the success of the integrated action plan we have just detailed will be measured by how it impacts positively on a number of key performance indicators including economic growth rates employment levels competitiveness black economic empowerment and small business development', 'for us to achieve maximum results with regard to these economic initiatives will require not only the commitment and energetic involvement of the government but the building of a strong partnership with both business and labour', 'i therefore renew our appeal to our social partners to work together with us in a mutually beneficial partnership for change', 'on previous occasions we have reported that we were working on both an integrated rural development strategy as well as an urban renewal programme', 'in both instances our central aim is to conduct a sustained campaign against rural and urban poverty and underdevelopment bringing in the resources of all three spheres of government in a coordinated manner', 'these programmes will among other things entail investment in the economic and social infrastructure human resource development enterprise development the enhancement of the development capacity of local government poverty alleviation and the strengthening of the criminal justice system', 'the new structure of local government in urban and rural areas will be the focal institution of government to ensure the coordinated implementation of our programmes with the ministry of provincial and local government acting as the national coordinating ministry', 'success in this work should have a positive impact on such areas as job creation crime and violence health and the general quality of life of millions of our people who lead desperate lives', 'though it took longer than we thought in fact to elaborate realistic and integrated government plans the individual departments and spheres of government have continued with their own programmes focused on these two matters of rural development and urban renewal', 'for example investments totalling more than r billion have been made through the consolidated municipal infrastructure programme over the last three years with  per cent spent in rural areas and  per cent in the urban areas', 'the work that will help us to move to a higher phase with regard to rural development has now been concluded', 'unfortunately i cannot say the same for the urban renewal programme except in the instance of two areas', 'in both instances the nodal points for the implementation of these programmes have been identified', 'with regard to rural development these are   the o', 'r', 'tambo north east ukhahlamba and eg kei district municipalities in the eastern cape   the umzinyathi umkhanyakude ugu and zululand district municipalities in kwazulunatal   the kgalagadi cross boundary district municipality in the northern cape and north west   the central karoo district municipality in the western cape', ' the sekhukhune cross boundary district municipality in mpumalanga and the northern province   the eastern district municipality in the northern province  and  the qwaqwa district municipality in the free state', 'with regard to the urban renewal programme the areas identified include   khayelitsha and mitchells plain in the western cape   kwamashu and inanda in kwazulunatal   mdantsane and motherwell in the eastern cape   alexandra township in gauteng  and  galeshewe in the northern cape', 'with regard to these areas we will only be able to act immediately with regard to alexandra township and kwamashu', 'work is going on to bring in the other areas as soon as possible', 'beginning from this year of the start of centenary celebrations in alexandra township r billion spread over seven years will be set aside to embark on an integrated development programme that will deliver housing roads water sanitation schools clinics magistrate offices and police stations', 'again i would like to emphasise that this does not mean that no work is being done in other areas', 'what we are addressing here is the elaboration and implementation of the urban renewal programme bringing together all three spheres of government', 'as we have already indicated the success of these plans will also depend on the extent to which the people can be mobilised so that they become active participants in the processes targeted at the upliftment of their own communities', 'we therefore repeat the call that we must all unite in action for change', 'the social sector also has its own targeted programme of action focused on the social upliftment of especially the most disadvantaged in our society', 'it will implement coordinated programmes in the nodal rural and urban areas we have identified which among other things will address such issues as housing water sanitation health including hivaids pension payouts household food security and nutrition poverty alleviation including the provision of certain amounts of free services home affairs services education and training sport and culture', 'naturally this does not mean that other areas of the country will be neglected', 'the sector will also focus on the complete transfer to their occupants of as many municipal houses as possible of the remaining   properties', 'special attention will be paid to a more vigorous extension of the system of sanitation to contain the outbreak of waterborne diseases', 'in addition to the continuing campaign against aids a more comprehensive approach to the health challenge in our country will be adopted to ensure an effective response to all infectious diseases including malaria tuberculosis stds cholera and hepatitis', 'similarly as already indicated in terms of some of the programmes we have already mentioned we have to respond more decisively to other diseases of poverty such as those that are caused by vitamin protein and energy deficiency', 'work will be completed on a comprehensive social security system to try to extend the safety net to as many people as possible bearing in mind the resource constraints we face and the need to ensure that we do not impact negatively on economic spending', 'we must again call on all our people to participate in the implementation of these programmes in the spirit of masakhane', 'the government will continue to pay the necessary attention to the issue of crime', 'we are very conscious of the fact that the safety and security of all our citizens is a fundamental right and a critical element in our continuing efforts to improve the quality of life of all our people', 'we want to arrive at the situation where all those who commit crime will know that they have nowhere to hide', 'the priority areas of focus with regard to the crime prevention and combating strategy will remain   high crime areas   organised crime including urban terrorism   crimes against women and children   corruption   cross border crime  and  social crime prevention', 'as we have already indicated the areas chosen as the lead points in our urban renewal programme will also be particular points of focus for our criminal justice system', 'the  priority police stations that we have identified in the past will also continue to receive the necessary attention and resources to enable them to do their work', 'in addition to other measures aimed at increasing the numbers of police personnel the south african police service will give all required assistance to the metropolitan councils to enable them to establish their municipal police services where these do not exist', 'the national directorate of public prosecutions and our courts will also continue with the measures they have already adopted to reduce and eliminate the unduly large backlog of cases that have not been tried', 'similarly work will continue to find a solution to the problem of overcrowding in our prisons caused especially by the large numbers of awaitingtrial prisoners', 'the criminal justice system will also further intensify its offensive against corruption among its own personnel', 'this will include the introduction of a new leadership at correctional services an increase in intelligence resources dedicated to the fight against corruption and where necessary the expansion of the existing anticorruption units', 'last july the minister of safety and security placed a moratorium on the use within the police service and the release of crime statistics', 'this was because of serious problems about the integrity and reliability of these statistics which among other things made it very difficult to design accurate and optimal operational plans in the fight against crime', 'the point needs to be understood that perhaps more than anybody else the ministry and the police service constantly need accurate and uptodate information on the incidence of crime to ensure proper deployment of human and material resources', 'accordingly extensive work has been and is being carried out to ensure the availability of this information', 'this has included and will include the training of over  people and the recruitment of about  people to specialise on the issue of crime information', 'at this moment it is expected that the moratorium will end at the end of june', 'the criminal justice cluster will also intensify its efforts to encourage further community involvement in the fight against crime and corruption', 'this will include the recruitment of   reservists especially in the already identified highcrime areas', 'once more this emphasises the importance of popular involvement in the common effort to change our country for the better', 'the challenge of ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the structures of government extends beyond the criminal justice system', 'it affects the entirety of government', 'the strengthening of the system of local government is one of the priorities the government has set itself', 'we are also focusing on the improvement of the quality of service delivery and efficiency in the use of public resources in all areas of government among other things to overcome the problem of under spending which continues to plague us', 'the gradual introduction of egovernment will assist us greatly to overcome these problems', 'the sustained implementation of the governments human resource development programme to improve management and other skills as well as to enhance respect and observance of the principle of batho pele is also of critical importance to the achievement of our objectives', 'we will soon convene a strategy meeting to assess progress and problems with regard to the fight against corruption in particular to ensure the implementation of decisions reached in the summit held about two years back', 'we will continue to take all necessary steps to limit this unacceptable practice', 'this will include thorough audits of some of the outgoing municipal councils after which decisive action will be taken against those found to have abused their positions for corrupt purposes', 'as parliament and the country are aware a successful public service job summit was held at the end of last month', 'i would like to quote some excerpts from the preamble of the framework agreement arrived at to show the commitment of the government and the public sector unions to serve the people of south africa', ' the parties to the public service job summit meet at a time in the history of our country when the challenge of managing a transformation process in the public service is upon each of us', 'it is a time when the parties face the twin challenge of transforming the public service to improve the reach depth efficiency and quality of social service delivery whilst at the same time improving the conditions of service quality and sustainability of jobs for employees of the public service', ' the parties acknowledge that they share a common commitment to a broader interest of serving the south african nation', 'accordingly the parties record their commitment to respect in words and deeds one another and to live by the spirit and letter of this agreement which shall govern the objectives principles and procedures for the management of the transformation process', '  the government applauds these sentiments and commits itself to honour the agreement it has entered into', 'furthermore we salute these freely agreed positions because they contain the important lesson for all of us that we need to unite in action to bring about the changes our country requires', 'i am very pleased that we have among us the former minister of intelligence the hon joe nhlanhla a principled and loyal patriot', 'the cruel misfortune of illhealth brought about by pressures of work has deprived all of us of his dedicated service', 'i am certain that you all join me in wishing him the speediest recovery possible so that we could once again draw on his considerable talents', 'we have entered the st century having resolved and declared to ourselves as africans and to the rest of the world that primarily none but ourselves can extricate us and our continent from the curse of poverty underdevelopment and marginalisation', 'the majority of people present in this chamber are south african', 'outwardly we are a people of many colours races cultures languages and ancient origins', 'yet we are tied to one another by a million visible and invisible threads', 'we share a common destiny from which none of us can escape because together we are human we are south african we are african', 'we have worked together for a decade to make of our country what for  years it was not', 'as a country undoubtedly all of us will have made mistakes as we sought to build what had never been there and will make yet more mistakes', 'but we were right and did not make a mistake when we agreed together that we will transform this common troubled motherland and set about the task of transforming it into a country of democracy peace equality and prosperity', 'many on our continent and elsewhere in the world were pleased to count this infant south africa as one of the jewels on the african crown', 'as these africans of many races and colours we will and must work with the rest of our continent and our partners across the globe to give life to a new millennium african recovery programme', 'together we must turn into reality a new internationalism that does not permit of the coexistence within human society of opulence and grinding poverty of a thriving modernity and a dehumanising underdevelopment', 'the burden of our prayer to you today has been that all of us must hold firm to the correct course we have chosen and hold firm to our resolve to walk that road together', 'ahead of us is a new century and a new millennium', 'we march into the new era of the african century as africans who have made the determination that this century will be a hundred years in which we cease to be victims of our circumstances but become victors', 'by what we do we will ensure that wars disease and underdevelopment are no longer seen as being synonymous with africans', 'through our own actions we will ensure that poverty gives way to prosperity', 'as we strengthen the bonds of friendship and solidarity with our fellow africans we have an obligation to help ensure that in our country and everywhere else on our continent no african child should ever again walk in fear of guns tyrants and abuse  that no african child should ever again experience hunger avoidable disease and ignorance  that no african child should ever again feel ashamed to be an african', 'our government democratically elected by the people of south africa will do its best to live up to these injunctions', 'we know it as a matter of fact that all men and women of conscience at home and everywhere else on our common planet will themselves take no other road but this one for which many across the oceans describe ours as a land of hope', 'thank you']"

dark clouds of despair are lifting giving way to our season of hope', 'our country which for centuries has bled from a thousand wounds is progressing towards its healing', 'the continuing process of social and national emancipation to which we are all subject constitutes an evolving act of selfdefinition', 'at the dawn of a new life our practical actions must ensure that none can challenge us when we say  we are a nation at work to build a better life  when the millions of our people went to vote three weeks ago in peaceful elections that were free and fair they guaranteed the permanence of the foundations from which we will advance to meet this objective', 'to these masses we owe the obligation to recommit the government on whose behalf i speak to the construction of a peoplecentred society', 'this i am happy to do with all the authority at my command', 'what will guide us in everything we do will be the challenge to build a caring society', 'this society must guarantee the dignity of every citizen on the basis of a good quality of life for every woman man and child without regard to race or colour or disability', 'it must be sustained by a growing economy capable of extending sustainable and equitable benefits to all our people', 'we seek to replace a society which in many instances has been and continues to be brutal and brutish in the extreme', 'over the centuries this has condemned millions to a catastrophic loss of national identity and human dignity land dispossession classification and denigration as subhumans and the systematic destruction of families and communities', 'the society we seek to replace was to a very significant degree built on the law of the jungle of the survival of the fittest', 'accordingly the weakest who were denied access to power became the landless the unemployed the uneducated the surplus people deported to the socalled homelands the victims of abject poverty', 'among these are those in our cities and towns who have lost all hope and all selfworth who have slid into a twilight world of drug and alcohol abuse the continuous sexual and physical abuse of women and children of purposeless wars fought with fists and boots with metal rods knives and guns everyday resulting in death and grievous bodily harm', 'the society we seek to replace entrenched corruption in all areas of human activity informed by the notion that the concepts of right and wrong are dead and therefore that everything that serves my personal interests is permissible', 'what we have said shows the enormity of the challenge we face to succeed in creating the caring society we have spoken of', 'for this reason this is not a task that can be carried out by the government alone', 'the challenge of the reconstruction and development of our society into one which guarantees human dignity faces the entirety of our people', 'it is a national task that calls for the mobilisation of the whole nation into united peoples action into a partnership with government for progressive change and a better life for all for a common effort to build a winning nation', 'the government therefore commits itself to work in a close partnership with all our people inspired by the call  faranani  to ensure that we draw on the energy and genius of the nation to give birth to something that will surely be new good and beautiful', 'we invite all those in our country who occupy positions of authority and power to join in this new way of doing things by engaging the people whom they serve and lead in the common effort to transform all of us into a people at work for a better south africa', 'one of the central features of the brutish society we seek to bring to an end is the impermissible level of crime and violence', 'acting together with the people we will heighten our efforts radically to improve the safety and security of all our citizens', 'this will entail a variety of measures focussed on ensuring the effective implementation of the national crime prevention strategy', 'let me mention a few of these relating mainly to policing', 'we will work to improve the professional competence and effectiveness of the police service by introducing new human resource development programmes', 'i am also pleased to announce that new recruits with the requisite levels of education will be brought into the service to help transform the police service into the pride of the nation', 'appropriate measures will be taken to give these recruits the necessary training so that they can assume their positions as soon as possible at all levels including the senior management echelon', 'at the same time all relevant regulations will be reviewed to ensure the proper promotion and deployment of serving members taking into account their competence honesty and dedication and the need to end the racial and gender imbalances within the police service', 'steps will be taken to review the conditions of service of the police service with a view to their improvement', 'this must also help us to ensure that we raise the public status of our policemen and police women so that they are seen correctly as the frontline guarantors of the fundamental human rights to liberty life safety and security', 'to enable our law enforcement agencies to translate this into reality i am privileged to announce that a special and adequately staffed and equipped investigation unit will be established urgently to deal with all national priority crimes including police corruption', 'i have directed that the ministers of safety and security defence intelligence justice home affairs and finance must finalise all outstanding matters which relate to the activation of this unit within a fortnight', 'coordination of all security organs will be improved in accordance with the provisions of the national crime prevention strategy', 'taking into account developments since its passage and to ensure that nobody benefits from the proceeds of crime amendments to the prevention of organised crime act will be introduced', 'legislation against money laundering will also be introduced', 'legislation will also be introduced to ensure that we can deal mercilessly with all crimes involving guns including the illegal possession of firearms the killing of police officers corruption within the criminal justice system and the intimidation of witnesses', 'a study conducted by the coordination and implementation unit in the office of the deputy president has confirmed what surely all of us have known of the correlation between crime poverty and race', 'the areas of high crime concentration including all crimes of violence are the black and poor areas of our country', 'these include such areas as tsolo in the eastern cape thabong in the free state katlehong in gauteng inanda in kwazulunatal kanyamazana in mpumalanga mafikeng in the north west galeshewe in the northern cape thohoyandou in the northern province and mitchellss plain in the western cape', 'we will therefore make multidisciplinary interventions in these areas starting with a few pilot areas drawing in all spheres of government and engaging the people themselves in an offensive to ensure that we reduce the levels of crime in these areas which are characterised by a high incidence of crime', 'measures will also be taken to strengthen the community police fora to improve their capacity to mobilise the people against crime and to improve cooperation between the people and the law enforcement agencies', 'as we have said the partnership between the government and the people will be one of the hallmarks of the national offensive against crime and violence', 'we will also adopt this same approach of partnership with the people in the fight against corruption', 'in this regard we must ensure that we pass the open democracy act and move speedily to ensure the implementation of the provisions relating to the protection of whistleblowers', 'the coming into force of the public finance management act will also increase our capacity to ensure proper control and accountability with regard to public finances', 'new steps will also be taken to ensure the enforcement of the code of conduct for public servants as well as the proposals that emerged from the government and national anticorruption conferences held during  and ', 'in this regard standing arrangements will be entered into requiring that the public service commission and the representatives of the private sector account publicly for the actions to which they committed themselves at the conferences', 'a further impetus will have to be given to the initiative of religious leaders against corruption to achieve the rdp of the soul which nelson mandela spoke about', 'i would like to take this opportunity once more to reiterate the commitment of our government to honest transparent and accountable government and our determination to act against anybody who transgresses these norms', 'the south african revenue service the police service and the director of public prosecutions will further strengthen their cooperation in the fight against financial and economic crimes', 'the example set by sars of openness with regard to violations of the law regardless of social standing of the violators will be maintained', 'urgent work is proceeding to determine the possibility of establishing special commercial crime courts as soon as possible as well as the gathering of the necessary complement of intelligence officers investigators and prosecutors to ensure that we deal effectively with whitecollar crime', 'the caring society of which we have spoken must of course successfully address the challenge of meeting the material needs of our people', 'the reconstruction and development programme rdp and the growth employment and redistribution programme gear were implemented by our first democratic government to achieve socioeconomic transformation and macroeconomic stability', 'the structural changes entailed within these processes were also to take place within the context of our economy becoming more competitive as it integrated itself within the global economy', 'the rdp and gear will remain the basic policy objectives of the new government to achieve sustainable growth development and improved standards of living', 'at the same time we will actively address any remaining impediments to investment and job creation', 'where the structural changes already achieved allow us to evolve new policies we will do so', 'among other things the revised gdp figures announced on the st of june confirm both the structural change that has taken place within our economy and the fact of a more robust economic performance than the pessimists would have us believe', 'the challenge remains for all of us to get to know the real south africa and in this context to fight back to defeat a frame of mind which drives some among us to hope and pray for failure and to celebrate such failure whenever it has occurred or when we have convinced ourselves that it has occurred', 'our task is to build on the achievements reflected in the economic realities reflected in the figures issued by statistics south africa at the beginning of this week', 'accordingly we have to work to increase both the level of investment and the savings ratio', 'this will include further steps to eliminate any dissaving by the state and to introduce incentives to encourage saving', 'the improvements in the deficit and debt ratios indicated in the latest gdp figures will also give us some space further to increase public sector capital expenditure', 'this will strengthen the improvement in capital expenditure by public authorities and public corporations reported in the gdp figures to which we have referred', 'the further transformation of the state machinery will result in changes to the public expenditure patterns against personnel costs in favour of capital expenditure including maintenance', 'these processes will also involve the provincial sphere of government', 'the municipal infrastructure programme is now beginning to progress', 'to increase the momentum requires further improvements in local government financial management', 'it also requires concerted action to promote publicprivate partnerships which must be constructed on a fiscally sound and sustainable basis', 'these matters affecting the critical local government sphere will be attended to in a vigorous manner', 'investment by the public sector is closely associated with the restructuring of state assets', 'progress in this area has been made over the last five years', 'we are now at a stage where further important restructuring can and will take place', 'in the telecommunications sector there will be further developments with the issuing of new licences', 'this will have a further positive impact on the expansion and modernisation of our telecommunications infrastructure the affordability of services to consumers and investment in the economy', 'i am happy to inform the honourable members that former minister jay naidoo will continue to work in this sector to assist in its further development domestically and to promote the african connection which is a critical element of the african renaissance', 'some of the most important developments with regard to the restructuring of state assets will relate to transnet', 'in part the priority given to this corporation arises from the fact that the transport and logistic system it contains underpins the success of other major investment projects', 'these include the spatial development initiatives the industrial development zones crossborder initiatives the industrial participation programmes arising out of the defence procurement as well as our overall export drive', 'the complex work that had to be done to prepare the transnet corporation for its restructuring enabled us to put part of the national carrier south african airways on the market', 'i am pleased to announce that the winning bidder is swissair which will acquire  per cent of saa at a price of r billion', 'we are very satisfied with this result convinced that it will bring maximum benefits to our country further strengthen our relations with the confederation of switzerland and again demonstrate in practical terms the importance of a measured approach towards the important issue of the restructuring of public assets', 'i would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate our new strategic partner and to thank the honourable stella sigcau for the work she did to enable us to reach the important stage we have during which we will deal with other business units within the transnet group', 'similarly the liquid fuels and petrochemical industry will be given priority with the ministries of minerals and energy trade and industry and public enterprises acting together', 'this includes finalisation of discussions with the government of mozambique with regard to a gas pipeline from their gas fields to south africa', 'the outcome of these processes will result in adding a highly competitive dimension to the productive economies of southern africa', 'the government will continue to intensify its work to facilitate investment by the private sector ensuring that the institutions that have been established to promote investment and the system of incentives achieve the desired results', 'further to improve our effectiveness in these areas we will shortly establish an international investment council', 'this prestigious council which will include some of the leading players in the global economy who are driven by a passionate desire to ensure that we succeed as a country will work with the president as well as our leading business people and trade unionists to help us ensure that south africa is an attractive destination for foreign investment', 'consistent with our determination to strengthen our partnership with the people for the achievement of our common goals four working groups will also be established bringing government together with big business the black business sector commercial agriculture and the trade unions', 'the development of small medium and micro enterprises remains a top priority of government', 'accordingly new measures will have to be instituted to record more success than has been the case to date', 'we have listened very carefully to what the actors in this area of the economy have said', 'accordingly the policy and institutional framework to support and encourage this sector is being reviewed', 'we will announce new decisions in this regard within the next three months', 'the government will also place more emphasis on the development of a cooperative movement to combine the financial labour and other resources among the masses of the people to rebuild our communities and engage the people in their own development through sustainable economic activity', 'there are two other areas that have an impact on investment', 'interest rates remain high', 'the reserve bank and the ministry of finance will continue to address this matter carefully conscious of the negative impact these high rates have on the desired higher rates of investment and growth', 'the other area that has attracted considerable comment is the labour market and its actual or perceived impact on investment and job creation', 'much of this commentary is ill informed or promotes a particular ideological or political point of view', 'the most recent independent study on this issue was published by the ilo in february this year', 'the report states that   one of the key findings of the study was that when compared to other middleincome countries labour regulations on dismissal fixedterm contracts and working conditions do not appear to be particularly onerous', 'a degree of numerical adaptability at exit does exist  thus dismissing the view that inflexible labour markets are at the heart of the employment problem', 'unfortunately employers perceive that the recent avalanche of labour market policy now make it more onerous to employ', 'these perceptions whilst they may not be rooted in reality when one considers the regulatory environment in other countries do appear to be influencing the behaviour of the economic actors', '  the government will continue to give priority to the issue of job creation', 'if perceptions or realities influence the process negatively these must be addressed', 'accordingly in keeping with the decisions taken at the job summit consultations have been taking place with our social partners to identify such possible areas', 'these include probation remedies for unfair dismissals dismissals for operational requirements the extension of bargaining council agreements and certain provisions of the basic conditions of employment act', 'we will continue to discuss these matters with our social partners to address the efficiency of the labour market', 'job creation the opening up of opportunities for all our people to earn an honest living as well as the protection of the rights of all our working people remain matters of critical concern to the government', 'we will continue actively to address all these matters including such important questions as skills development the casualisation of labour illegal foreign workers and workers whose rights are not protected', 'all necessary measures will be taken to ensure the implementation of all other decisions taken at the job summit', 'the necessary funds have already been voted to meet the commitments the government made at this summit', 'all our partners have an obligation themselves publicly to report on the actions they have taken and are taking to honour their undertakings', 'an important project that will soon be implemented within the context of the job summit will be the improvement of public buildings to enhance access and use by disabled people', 'this initiative elaborated by the disabled the national youth commission and public works will be implemented soon as part of the programme decided at the job summit', 'the umsobomvu fund for youth development and training will become operational as soon as the old mutual has completed its demutualisation process', 'the board of trustees of the national development agency will be constituted shortly', 'hopefully this will assist in ensuring the further mobilisation of the people themselves to participate in the development process as agents working for social change and their own advancement', 'i am pleased to announce that immediately the minister of trade and industry will make recommendations to the government with regard to those who competed to run our national lottery', 'this important matter will be concluded within the next fourteen days', 'in a few months it will be possible to allocate even more resources to the promotion of the good causes to which the government and institutions such as the nda and the idt are committed', 'madam speaker the rural areas of our country represent the worst concentrations of poverty', 'no progress can be made towards a life of human dignity for our people as a whole unless we ensure the development of these areas', 'the government is now in a position to implement a rural development programme for the integrated development of the rural areas', 'this will bring together all government departments and all spheres of government including the traditional leaders', 'the integration we seek must for instance ensure that when a clinic is built there must be a road to access it', 'it must be electrified and supplied with water', 'it must have the requisite personnel qualified to meet the health needs of the particular community', 'the safety and security of the personnel and material resources which are part of the clinic must be guaranteed', 'we must also establish the conditions which give the possibility to this medical point to radiate outwards as a point of reference with regard to the larger project of our selfdefinition as a people at work building a better life for ourselves', 'consistent with our concentration on this objective including the critical importance of jobs the government remains preoccupied with the issue of gold sales and their impact on gold mining employment and export earnings both in our own country and the rest of our continent', 'working within the gold crisis committee we will continue to maintain contact will all relevant players both domestically and throughout the world to minimise the inevitable adverse effect on our country our people and our continent', 'the debt burden of those who cannot both carry this debt and achieve sustained development must be addressed', 'in the same way that we have demonstrated our own commitment to contribute to the development of others less fortunate than ourselves by forgiving the debts of some of our neighbours we expect that those who are a thousand time wealthier than we are will not seek to help us as africans by rendering us less capable of standing on our own feet', 'further to improve the quality of life of all our people especially the most disadvantaged the government will maintain its approach to reprioritise public spending to maintain and improve the safety net available to the most disadvantaged in our society', 'it is however vital that we improve the quality of spending in these areas and therefore the delivery of services to the people', 'this will be done by managing downwards the amounts spent on personnel rooting out corruption and theft improving management skills throughout the social sector and ensuring an integrated interdepartmental approach to the delivery of services', 'special programmes will also be introduced to speed up the improvement of the quality of life of various sections of our population', 'these will include the accelerated delivery of assistive devices for the disabled and the establishment of onestop centres for abused women and children', 'the office on the status of women will present a gender audit to government by september', 'this will enable the government to evaluate the progress achieved with regard to the implementation of the plan of action on gender which the previous government adopted', 'this will enable us to take such decisions as may be necessary to ensure that we continue to focus on the vital question of the development and emancipation of women as well as further integrate this issue within all government programmes', 'the advances made in this national parliament and the national executive with regard to gender equity point to the need to adopt a similar approach with regard to all other centres of authority and power in our society', 'similarly the government will tighten its tracking of the poverty question to ensure that government policies and programmes are actually succeeding to reduce the levels of poverty in our country', 'the funds set aside for poverty alleviation will also be allocated without further delay and will be used not as handouts but as a catalyst towards sustainable development', 'the government will also review all the work done so far to confront the scourge of hivaids with a view to the intensification of all efforts relating to this epidemic', 'of critical importance will be that we take all necessary steps to ensure that the partnerships against hivaids that have been formed and the public education campaigns we have been conducting do actually result in changing behaviour patterns improve support to aids victims and orphans and speed up steps towards the development of a vaccine', 'an historic document of the people of our country asserts that as a consequence of the victory of the struggle for national liberation  the doors of education and learning shall be open to all  many people including our youth died and sacrificed for the realisation of this objective', 'they did so because they understood the importance for themselves and all our communities of the right to freedom from ignorance', 'consistent with this correct view we must ensure that education and training constitute the decisive drivers in our effort to build a winning nation', 'the government will therefore intensify its focus on education so that we succeed in our effort to produce an educated and appropriately skilled population', 'a great deal of work has been done in this area affecting all levels of education and training', 'we will therefore ensure that existing policies and programmes are carried out with a sense of urgency and commitment to their success', 'to achieve these results we will also have to engage in massive inservice training programmes for educators in all fields and at all levels as well as the transformation of preservice training', 'we will have to focus on an outcomesbased assessment as well as on quality management systems', 'our human resource development strategies will only succeed if the people assigned to develop our human resources have the capacity to do so', 'all necessary steps must and will be taken to ensure that learners learn educators educate and managers manage', 'once more we will also take the necessary measures to mobilise the people including the parents so that we succeed as a country to meet the challenge of educating all our people in a manner that is consistent with the demands imposed on everybody by the process of globalisation', 'the government is also determined to ensure that the machinery of state is geared towards serving the people in keeping with the vision of batho pele  we will speed up the completion of the skills and service audits currently being carried out', 'this audit is aimed at defining service needs the availability of skills and the possibilities for redeployment to support the process of the restructuring of the public service', 'action will be taken on the basis of this audit as well as other initiatives to rightsize the public service to improve skills levels to improve the quality of management and release more resources for the actual provision of services to the people', 'we will also work with the south african local government association to lend all necessary assistance to ensure that this sphere of government improves its effectiveness and efficiency bearing in mind that this is the point at which our entire system of government delivers services to the people', 'in this context we must make the point that to overcome the problem of urban poverty will require that local government adopts and pursues a consistent programme of poverty relief without discrimination on the basis of race or colour', 'our government is ready and willing to support this effort', 'the promotion and protection of the cultural linguistic and religious rights of all our people must occupy a central place in the work of government', 'it should not happen that anyone of us should feel a sense of alienation', 'whatever the sicknesses of our society none should be driven to levels of despair which drive them to a peripheral existence at the fringes of the mainstream', 'nor should we allow that those who were denied their identity including the khoi and the san continue to exist in the shadows a passing historical relic and an object of an obscene tourist curiosity', 'we consider the work of restoring the pride and identity of all our people of vital importance to the task of advancing the human dignity of all our citizens and ensuring the success of our efforts towards national reconciliation and nation building', 'we will work for the speedy implementation of the constitutional requirement to establish a commission for the promotion and protection of language cultural and religious rights', 'we will also work with the traditional leaders to resolve all outstanding matters relating to the important question of the role of our traditional leaders in our system of governance', 'the ministries of sports and recreation as well as arts culture science and technology will play a special role with regard to the critical work to ensure that all our cultures and languages occupy their rightful place within the rich tapestry that constitutes our diverse being as a people', 'this will be an important contribution to the effort we must sustain to wipe out the legacies of racism and sexism which continue to afflict our society', 'capacity will be created within the presidency to ensure that our government at its highest levels gives attention to all these questions which bear on nation building', 'the government will also focus on the tasks of achieving the objectives of the african renaissance and ensuring that the next century evolves as the african century', 'we will therefore contribute whatever we can towards the resolution of conflicts on our continent', 'we cannot accept that war violent conflict and rapine are a permanent condition of existence for us as africans', 'nor can we accept that our continent endowed with enormous human and natural resources is incapable of achieving sustained development', 'everyday all those who will hear and see are exposed to the extraordinary integrated cultural heritage which both captures our african past and is an important factor that will contribute towards the recovery of our pride and dignity', 'gradually africa will work her way towards the resumption of her rightful place among the continents of our globe', 'where necessary we will call on the services of such outstanding african statespersons as former presidents mwalimu julius nyerere sir ketumile masire and nelson mandela to assist in the promotion of this agenda', 'as part of the world community of nations we will make our due contribution to the construction of a new world order that will be responsive to the needs of especially the poor of the world', 'for us to succeed in our work both as a government and as a people will require that we approach the tasks ahead with all due seriousness and a sense of discipline which recognises the fact that all rights are accompanied by obligations', 'it will require that all of us defend the freedoms and the system of government guaranteed and created by our constitution underpinned by the understanding that the people are the final guarantors of our democracy the subject of all government policies and their own liberators', 'as the people went to the polls earlier this month protected among others by our national defence force which had also acted to defend life and democracy in lesotho they expected that the government they would elect would work selflessly to respond to their needs and aspirations bearing in mind resource limitations', 'we dare not and will not disappoint that expectation', 'as a tribute to these masses i would like to salute all the provincial winners of the presidents award for community initiative', 'i am happy to announce that the national winner of the award whose work focused on such important issues as poverty alleviation the emancipation of women the rebuilding of communities domestic violence and providing education on hivaids is the makgaung community project of the northern province', 'may the selfless and creative work carried out by the women of the northern province serve to inspire all of us to spare no effort in the struggle to create a caring society', 'we sit in this parliament authorised by these women from the northern province and others who mirror them throughout our country to work as their representatives', 'we must assume that they were wise to have selected us', 'if they were as we must accept in our self interest that they were this we must accept also that none of us should forsake their wisdom as it will watch over us as we carry out our tasks', 'their wisdom will protect us exalt and honour us even as it costs us all we have including the vanity of our prejudices', 'if by word and deed we take our places among the ordinary people who position themselves among a nation that is at work to build a better life for all within a caring society then should we expect that the poor of the world will set a garland of grace on our heads and present each and everyone of us with a crown of splendour', 'thus will we all arrive at the starting point  that we are on course  thank you']"

president and deputy president of the senate honourable speaker and deputy speaker of the national assembly chairperson and deputy chairperson of the constitutional assembly deputy presidents ministers and deputy ministers provincial premiers chief justice president of the constitutional court leaders of the national defence force the police service and the correctional service directors general and leaders of the public service honourable members of parliament distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen  we have gathered in this hallowed chamber to begin the work of the second session of our democratic parliament nine months after its first members were sworn in', 'let met say this from the beginning that the challenges ahead of us require that we move away from spectacle and rhetoric and bend our backs to the serious work ahead of us', 'i would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere appreciation to the leaders of all the parties represented in parliament the members of parliament the presiding officers the whips the chairpersons of committees the secretary of parliament and his staff for the sterling work that was done from the day that this first democratic and nonracial parliament convened', 'of necessity much of this work had to do with the establishment of our organisations structures and evolving a rhythm of work which would enable us to discharge our responsibilities in an effective and efficient manner', 'all of us precisely because we had never sat in any democratic parliament before had to begin the continuing process of learning how to carry out our functions as peoples deputies', 'we had to educate ourselves in an atmosphere characterised by a critical public focus which did not necessarily allow for the reality of that inexperience', 'undoubtedly many of us both in the legislature and in the executive have made mistakes', 'but mistakes are an inevitable element of any process of learning', 'it is always the case that the spectators are better than the players on the field', 'none of us should therefore feel ashamed for having committed errors', 'we must however learn from these mistakes so that we do indeed improve our performance', 'whatever it is that our critics might have to say we can take pride in the fact that not only did we succeed to establish our two houses of parliament as required by the constitution but we also ensured that they play their role in the government of our country', 'we are pleased that the honourable members of both the national assembly and the senate have not been satisfied merely to endorse the bills that have been presented to them but have participated actively in improving such draft legislation with the aim of ensuring that our laws are consistent with the glorious vision we share of creating a truly humane and peoplecentred society', 'of particular importance is the fact that you the legislators have worked in a manner consistent with the objective of ensuring that ours should be a parliament of the people', 'this we have done by opening our proceedings to the public to ensure that the people know what we are doing and by opening the doors to the people to address the legislative committees of parliament directly', 'this has also been replicated in our provincial legislatures consistent with our objective of bringing government as close to the people as possible', 'we can therefore claim with justification that such legislating as has been approved is representative of the will of the people and therefore enjoys a degree of legitimacy and enforceability which all previous laws could never have', 'undoubtedly we must continue to look for ways and means of ensuring that the people as a whole are better informed of what we are doing and are given ever improved capacity to intervene in our proceedings in an informed and purposive manner', 'in the recent past much has been said about corruption among some members of this parliament and other leading political figures in the country', 'many within and without this chamber and among the mass media have been very keen to condemn and to propel us into precipitate action on the basis of mere allegations', 'we have resisted this and will continue to do so', 'we have a responsibility to act on the basis of fact and not allegations however strident the voice that makes those allegations', 'furthermore we firmly believe that it is important that we build a society on justice and fairness', 'at all times we must guarantee the right of the accused to be heard without making any concession to a primeval instinct to pillory and burn people at the stake', 'as south africans with our particular history we must be extremely careful not to reintroduce the mccarthyism atmosphere which resulted in people being herded into unthinking hordes that sought the blood of anybody who was labelled a communist', 'we must also make this clear that we need no educators with regard to the matter of rooting out corruption which we will deal with firmly and unequivocally whoever may be involved', 'we are conscious of the reality that corruption in many forms has deeply infected the fibre of our society', 'it is not possible to have a society based on a lie and patent injustice as apartheid society was without this spawning corrupt practices', 'precisely because we face the challenge of dealing with systematic corruption we need a dispassionate and systematic approach to this question and not allow ourselves to be stampeded by responses which are not very different from a witchhunt', 'to address another important matter of the day later this year we will be holding our local government elections to complete the process of establishing the democratic structures which we need to ensure that the people are able to take their destiny into their own hands', 'the importance of these popularly elected structures at the local level cannot be overestimated', 'it is at this level that we must deliver change', 'it is at this level that the people can most directly participate in making decisions about important matters that affect their daily lives', 'it is also at this level that we must confront the divisions created by the system of apartheid and grapple with the problems that arise out of the racial and territorial maldistribution of resources and infrastructure that was imposed on the country by this system', 'in reality it is impossible to enter this next and critical stage of the dismantling of the system of apartheid until we have democratically elected structures of government which enjoy a popular mandate to bring about the nonracial nonsexist and democratic society demanded of us by the constitution', 'i would therefore like to take this opportunity to call on all our people in their millions to take the forthcoming local government elections very seriously', 'the immediate task that we must all fulfil is to register as voters', 'i appeal to all political parties both those represented in our national and provincial legislatures and those outside of these structures to do everything in their power to mobilise the people to register as voters', 'this appeal also extends to all other peoples organisations and institutions of civil society to use their influence or organise the people to register for an participate in the local government elections', 'it is also the obligation of all political organisations that will participate in the local government elections to ensure that we experience no violence or intimidation during the conduct of our election campaigns', 'it would also like to take advantage of this occasion to make it very clear to the country as a whole that the government will not allow anybody to obstruct the process of the registration of voters regardless of the social status of the persons concerned', 'it is important to bear in mind that unlike our elections of last year these elections will be conducted with democratically elected national and provincial government in place', 'these governments will not hesitate to use all legitimate force at their disposal to ensure that nobody stands in the way of the people to express their will freely', 'i am also pleased to report that whatever the teething problems the concept and vision of a government of national unity has proved its correctness and viability', 'it has succeeded in its intentions of ensuring cooperation among our people as a whole the development of a national consensus around a whole range of important matters enabling important minority parties to have a real voice in the government of the country and contributing to peace stability and confidence in the future of our country', 'at the national level we continue to work together in a nonconfrontational atmosphere further to elaborate rules conventions and procedures to ensure that the government of national unity functions effectively and is able to address in a balanced way the fact of different parties with different policies and the tension between the democratic rights of the majority party and the effective participation of the minority parties', 'in this regard i should mention that we have agreed with the provincial premiers that we will share our views on these matters with them and their administrations to evolve common practices conducive to good governance', 'happily all the major parties have committed themselves to the perspectives contained in the commonlyevolved reconstruction and development programme', 'this constitutes the firm basis for the continuing cooperation among the various parties inside and outside the government of national unity without which such cooperation would become impossible', 'we must however also make this point that when all is said and done as individuals and as parties we belong to the same government', 'we therefore have a collective responsibility both to participate in the formulation of policy and the elaboration of decisions and to defend take responsibility for and implement those decisions', 'in the period ahead of us we shall therefore insist on the collective responsibility and accountability of everybody concerned as part of a process in which we must all engage of raising the levels of discipline and responsible action throughout the society', 'a few days ago we were honoured to participate in the moving and historic opening of our constitutional court', 'this is yet another giant step in the transformation of our judicial system and the building of a lawgoverned society which will protect the fundamental human rights of all our citizens and ensure that the people are not threatened by arbitrary and oppressive rule', 'the process of the transformation of the judiciary will continue among other things to ensure that it is representative of our society and to enable even the poor to have the ability to obtain legal redress where need arises', 'all necessary steps will also be taken to ensure that the judicial system plays its proper role with regard to the important matter of reducing the levels of crime in our society and addressing the legitimate concern of the public that we do not create the situation in which the people begin to feel that criminals and wrongdoers are being favoured while the interests of society are being ignored', 'further progress will also be made this year to establish other institutions that are critical to the construction of the peoplecentred society to which we are all committed  among these will be the human rights commission the public protector the gender and youth commissions the inspector general of intelligence and the structures that will be created by the pending open democracy or freedom of information act', 'we are determined to move with all due speed to create and strengthen all the institutions of governance that we have spoken of to deal with the matter of effective and open government', 'once more we must address a few words to our public service without whose dedicated service to the people effective government and public delivery to the population will be impossible', 'we are committed to the motivation of all public sector workers so that they become a conscious willing and skilled agent for the transformation of our society according to the objectives spelt out in the reconstruction and development programme', 'as part of this process cabinet has given instructions to all ministers to interact continuously with all members of their ministries and departments to brief them about their tasks to report on progress achieved to agree on how to overcome obstacles to the process of transformation and generally to be involved in the struggle for change', 'we have also invited the public sector unions to participate as fully as possible in the budgeting processes so that they make their own contribution to the difficult task of deciding the best possible allocation of the limited resources available to government', 'we are convinced that an adversarial relationship between the executive and the administration would impact negatively on the common task which these two institutions share of serving the people of south africa', 'such an outcome must be avoided at all costs', 'accordingly we have been available and willing to address all matters of concern to the public service workers including questions of salaries promotions pensions and other issues relevant to working conditions', 'it is however also important that the public service should be willing to join hands with the government to address other important matters such as the racial and gender imbalances within the public service', 'the public service will never be fully acceptable to the people as a whole and can never be truly responsive to the needs of the people unless it is composed in all its ranks in a manner that reflects the composition of our population', 'to speed up this process the government will continue to implement measures and programmes aiming at ensuring that those who were disadvantaged by apartheid in the past are given the capacity to catch up with those who were given the possibility to develop and advance themselves in terms of management and other skills', 'this is what we mean when we talk of affirmative action programmes', 'we speak of a human resource development programme which will ensure that all our people and not merely some are given the possibility to develop their talents and to contribute to the reconstruction and development of society to the best of their ability', 'i therefore call on all our people to refuse to listen to the false prophets who seek to perpetuate the apartheid divisions and imbalances of the past by presenting affirmative action as a programme intended to advantage some and disadvantage others on the basis of race and colour', 'it is also appropriate that on this occasion we draw the attention of the country to the actual reality that the government has extremely limited resources to address the many and urgent needs of our people', 'we are very keen that this real situation should be communicated to the people as a whole', 'all of us especially the leadership of political organisations and civil society must rid ourselves of the wrong notion that the government has a big bag full of money', 'the government does not have such riches', 'because we have started the process of changing spending priorities we do realise that the process of restructuring the budget so that it is directed towards addressing the needs of the people is no easy matter', 'this is especially so in the light of the contractual obligations that bind the state as well as carry over expenditure which cannot be avoided', 'we must all absorb this reality into our thinking in a cold and dispassionate manner and not allow ourselves to be seduced into a world of false hopes leading to unrealistic actions based on the wrong assumption that the government can be coerced to meet demands that it cannot meet however justified and legitimate these demands might be', 'it is important that we rid ourselves of the culture of entitlement which leads to the expectation that the government must promptly deliver whatever it is that we demand and result in some people refusing to meet their obligations such as rent and service payments or engaging in other unacceptable actions such as the forcible occupation of houses', 'as we have said with regard to the public sector unions we seek to ensure that the budgeting process is as transparent and as participatory as possible', 'it is the right of the people to know how much money they have contributed to the finances of the state and how that money is being used', 'it is their right also not only to know but also to contribute their views as to how public funds should be disbursed', 'that is why such bodies as the parliamentary committees and the national economic forum have been brought into the budgeting process', 'tomorrow we shall be launching a very important body the national economic development and labour council nedlac', 'this crucial body will bring together representatives of government labour capital and civil society', 'this will be one of the institutions on which we will relay in terms of decisions that we must arrive at with regard to the use of public funds and assets', 'we trust that the representatives that sit of nedlac will in turn reach out to their own constituencies to inform and involve them in the process of arriving at decisions which bear among other things on the disbursement of public funds', 'what we have said constitutes a firm undertaking on the part of government to ensure a participatory process with regard to the public finances', 'bearing this in mind we believe that government has a right to expect that the public at large should behave in a responsible manner when it addresses the question of the obligations of government to meet the material expectations of the people', 'i would like to address this matter bluntly', 'the strike action which has been threatened by a few of the public sector unions will not succeed to force the government to make available money for large wage and salary increases', 'i say this being fully aware and sympathetic to the plight of many public sector workers who are indeed poorly paid', 'i say it precisely because i am aware of the reality that for no fault of its own the government literally does not have the money to meet the demands that are being advanced', 'mass action of any kind will not create resources that the government does not have and would only serve to subvert the capacity of government to serve the people', 'i would like to repeat that the government is committed to entering into a comprehensive threeyear agreement with the public sector unions to address all matters of mutual interest including improved packets particularly for the lowestpaid public sector workers', 'in this regard i would like to extend our sincere appreciation to the leaders and the majority of the public sector unions which have engaged with us in a constructive manner which is sensitive to the needs of the country as a whole', 'we are ready to work together with these unions to solve the problems which face us together for the benefit of the workers and society as a whole', 'i must also address the question of the attempt by some in our country to introduce anarchy into our society', 'i speak of those who engage in such totally unacceptable practices as the murder of police officers the taking of hostages riots looting the forcible occupation of public buildings blocking of public highways vandalisation of public and private property and so on', 'some of those who have initiated and participated in such activities have misread freedom to mean license', 'they have misinterpreted popular participation to mean their ability to impose chaos on society', 'they have wrongly concluded that an elected government of the people is a government that is open to compulsion through acts of anarchy', 'let me therefore make this abundantly clear that the small minority in our midst which wears the mask of anarchy will meet its match in the government we lead and the masses of the people who put that government into office', 'this they must know that we are not afraid of struggle', 'we are after all a product of confrontation and struggle', 'in the past we were not defeated by forces more powerful than they', 'in this instance we will not be defeated by those whose actions have nothing to do with defending or advancing the cause of the people', 'we are certain that the democratic trade unions movement will also join hands with us to isolate and defeat the minority which seeks to discredit the trade union movement by engaging in violent activities during the course of strike actions', 'let is therefore be clear to all that the battle against the forces of anarchy and chaos has been joined', 'let no one say they have not been warned', 'in the same vein we must address the question of crime', 'the situation cannot be tolerated in which our country continues to be engulfed by the crime wave which includes murder crimes against women and children drug trafficking armed robbery fraud and theft', 'we must take the war to the criminals and no longer allow the situation in which we are mere sitting ducks of those in our society who for whatever reason are bent to engage in criminal and antisocial activities', 'instruction have therefore already gone out to the minister of safety and security the national commissioner of the police service and the security organs as a whole to take all necessary measures to bring down the levels of crime', 'i would also like to take this opportunity to emphasise that the matter of our safety and security is not one that should be left only to the law enforcement organs', 'for them to succeed they need the full and active support of all our communities', 'the policecommunity fora that have been established are extremely important with regard to reinforcing cooperation between the police and the public and therefore increasing the capacity of the country as a whole to deal with the common problem of crime', 'i would therefore like to urge the formation of such fora where they do not exist and the involvement of all opinion makers in all localities in the processes which are aimed at enhancing the peoples safety and security', 'the government is determined to do everything in its power to move speedily towards the formation of the new police service', 'we are very interested to address the matter of the earnings and working conditions of all members of the police service and to give this service the necessary means to enable it do discharge its responsibilities as effectively as possible', 'in this regard we must also make it clear that the government is opposed to and has no intention to conduct a witchhunt against the police as a result of activities arising from orders given to o the police by the apartheid regime', 'we therefore urge every member of the police service to get down to the urgent and pressing matter of enhancing the safety and security of the people as a whole', 'when we opened parliament last year we addressed the issue of racism in the workplace and in our society at large', 'we continue to be confronted by this problem', 'people have continued to die as a result of the continuing practice of racism  the latest being a victim of racist resistance to the use of a former white school by lack children', 'those who are responsible for these crimes of racism must be brought to book without delay', 'it is clear that insufficient progress has been made in many workplaces and elsewhere in our society to deal with this cancer', 'we trust that the human rights commission will help us to deal with this matter firmly and continuously by encouraging the public to report all instances of racism so that these can be brought to light', 'the government has discussed this matter and is committed to carry out its constitutional obligation of transforming our country into a nonracial society', 'the situation cannot be allowed in which anyone acts in a manner which perpetuates the practice of apartheid', 'both the government and the people as a whole share a common obligation to live up to the very purpose of the struggle that millions of people waged of ending racism in our country and ensuring the equality of all our people', 'one of the most sensitive matters we must address this year is the establishment of the truth and reconciliation commission', 'we must move towards this as speedily as possible so as to remove all the uncertainties that have been created through the protracted discussion of this issue', 'the legislature is currently discussing the bill dealing with this matter and is receiving public submissions', 'i would like to urge that we achieve speedy progress in this regard', 'i would also like to draw the attention of the legislature and the country as a whole that our purpose in establishing the truth and reconciliation commission is both to obtain the truth and to reinforce the process of reconciliation which our country needs', 'nothing we do should lead to the heightening of tensions and the rekindling of the violent political conflicts which we have succeeded so well to bring under reasonable control', 'this must also be borne in mind that many of us who suffered quite significantly as a result of apartheid repression are making no demands which would result in vengeance against or persecution of those who might have harmed us or those close to us', 'urgent steps are also required to end the continuing political violence in the province of kwazulunatal', 'this is both a lawenforcement issue and a matter for the political parties and leaders in the province to address', 'if we claim to be genuine leaders of our people it must surely be one of our principle tasks to end the killing both to save lives and to create the climate of peace and stability which we need to develop the province which is among the poorest areas in the country', 'progress has been made with regard to the basic challenge of building a better life for all our people', 'some of the projects which we announced last year including the feeding of school children and the provision of free health services to certain sections of our population have been implemented', 'it is necessary that we draw the necessary lessons from our experience in this effort to meet the basic needs of the people', 'one of these as we have stated already is that the government has very limited resources to address the multiple and urgent needs of our people', 'it is therefore critical that we determine a proper set of priorities on which we should focus to effect a visible and sustainable improvement in the lives of the people', 'it is also important that we implement any projects in this regard not in an adhoc manner but within the context of year and other medium and longterm plans and projections', 'the cabinet has discussed this matter and decided on our priorities which will include rural and urban development human resource development job creation and health', 'detailed interdepartmental work is now going on to elaborate plans reflecting this focus to ensure that the government uses in a rational and effective manner the limited resources at its disposal', 'in this regard government will not make any commitments which it cannot meet on a continuous basis', 'as compared to the time last year when we had to announce programmes for transformation without detailed preparation of implementable and affordable plans we are now in the fortunate situation that we are well on the way to finalising detailed plans to meet our firm commitment to build a better life for all south africans', 'once they are ready and after the necessary consultation with the elected representatives at both national and provincial levels the local community structures and the public at large we are determined this year to move speedily to expedite the process of social transformation and the improvement of the quality of life of our people which is required of us in the context of our programme for reconstruction and development', 'this will be one of the high points in our national life this year when we announce realistic targets with regard to such needs as houses clean water primary health care and jobs', 'i must repeat that it is our firm intention that we set these targets within the parameters of what the budget can carry consistent with our objective of ensuring fiscal discipline', 'we will be able to achieve this degree of precision because of the significant progress that has been made in the various ministries at both national and provincial levels with regard both to the reorganisation and strengthening these structures and the elaboration of policies aimed at the fundamental transformation of our country', 'for this we should salute the ministers the premiers the directors general and other members of the public service for the work they have done to increase the capacity of government to engage in the process of transformation', 'with regard to this critical matter of socioeconomic transformation i would once again like to draw attention to the important role that nedlac will have to play to ensure effective coordination and partnership between government labour business and communitybased organisations', 'this body will play a critical role in helping to develop the consensus we need with regard to the critical challenges of reconstruction and development including economic growth socioeconomic improvement and the involvement of all stakeholders in all decisionmaking processes', 'in a sense nedlac and other fora where consensus is being achieved across the social spectrum are crucial power houses of our nationbuilding and reconstruction efforts', 'they are the engine which cannot be derailed by the whims of individuals or political parties', 'as the year begins there are signs that our economy is beginning to pick up', 'the government sondiers it a matter of critical importance that everything should be done to encourage a climate conducive to sustained and high levels of economic growth', 'we are therefore ready to deal and have been dealing with all matters that are relevant to this goal in particular to ensure the creation of an investorfriendly climate', 'everything must be done to encourage a significant upward movement in the rate of investment to increase the productive capacity of the economy to modernise and restructure the economy to create jobs and to increase our international competitiveness', 'with regard to these economic issues i would also like to emphasise our continuing commitments to fiscal discipline including the reduction of the budget deficit the reduction of the share of the national income that accrues to government and the reorientation of government expenditure away from recurrent disbursements towards investment', 'the relevant authorities including the reserve bank remain seized of the issue of the twotier exchange rate and the general question of foreign exchange controls', 'these matters will be addressed with the necessary speed and the equally necessary sense of responsibility towards the economy as a whole', 'at the same time the government is working as expeditiously as possible to address the question of the reorganisation of state assets', 'with regard to these assets our objective is to ensure that they are used in a conscious and consistent manner to address the objectives of the rdp one of these must surely be to reduce the public debt and therefore the burden of servicing this debt so that more public funds can be released to address the needs of the people', 'this year parliament will be faced with a heavy load of extremely important legislation that it will have to deal with', 'the importance of this legislation derives from the fact that it will be transformative in character aimed at the creation of the social order which for which many struggled and sacrificed', 'one of these pieces of legislation is the labour relations bill which represents not only a decisive shift from our adversarial past in labour relations but also our commitment to a more democratic style of governance', 'while correctly entrenching the right of workers to resort to strike action the bill places emphasis on conciliation and negotiation of disputes and should contribute significantly to reducing the level of unnecessary industrial action and creating greater possibilities for joint action between government labour and business to build a prosperous and just society', 'similarly white papers and legislation will be introduced covering such areas as education health housing water affairs safety and security defence truth and reconciliation freedom of information land affairs the public service welfare and so on to say nothing of the  budget', 'this will undoubtedly tax the energies of the members and resources of parliament', 'however we will have to ensure that we deal with all this legislation as expeditiously as possible while consulting the people also as extensively as possible', 'we should therefore have an exciting session which should inspire all or people as they see their elected representatives create the legislative framework which will mark our continued movement away from the past towards the peoplecentred society we seek to construct', 'we will also have to ensure that the constitutional assembly makes progress towards the drafting to the new constitution', 'it is important that this should be done so that we can have certainty as soon as possible about the constitutional framework within which the country should be governed', 'it may be worth repeating that we seek a constitution that is acceptable to the people as a whole', 'it was for this reason that all of those who participated in the drafting of the present constitution agreed to the concept of special majorities and an entrenchment set of principles', 'as we negotiate the new constitution it is necessary to bear these observation in mind and conduct ourselves in a manner that ensures that we have as inclusive a process as possible', 'it seems necessary that there should be close cooperation and coordination between the legislature and the constitutional assembly with regard to the issue of consultation with the public as both these bodies will be seeking to reach as many people as possible during this year', 'we will have to conduct the processes of public consultation in a manner that is both cost effective and enables the people genuinely to contribute both to the legislative and the constitutional debates', 'this year the nations will be observing the related th anniversaries of the end of the second world war and the establishment of the united nations organisation', 'coming as we do from our own specific past it will be important that we join in the observance of these historic events', 'thus should we affirm our own commitment to the vision contained in the universal declaration on human rights the un charter and other important legal instruments and conventions that the un has evolved to deal with the issues of racism war and peace human rights and development', 'among these conventions which will be ratified during the course of this parliamentary session is the very important international convention on the rights of the child', 'we might also want to use this occasion to make our contribution to the international debate about the new world order focusing in particular on such matters as a democratic international political order universal prosperity peace and stability  all of which are questions of great relevance to our own continent of africa', 'in this regard the un social summit next month and the international womens conference in beijing later in the year will be crucial fora in which we should make our own humble contribution to the effort to create a better world', 'in this context during this year we will pay particular attention to the allround development and strengthening of our relations with our neighbours in southern africa especially within the context of the sadc', 'we are all inspired by the reality of progressive developments in our region during the recent period', 'these include the successful democratic elections in malawi mozambique namibia botswana and our own country the restoration of democracy in lesotho and the signing of the angola peace agreement', 'all this augurs well for the future of all our peoples', 'at the same time we are all aware of the tensions that are building up with regard to population movements within our region', 'we must treat this matter with all due sensitivity conscious of the history of our region including the destruction caused by the policy of aggression and destabilisation carried out by the previous regime', 'in all our actions we must move from the position that the fundamental objective we must pursue is friendship cooperation and solidarity among the peoples of our region', 'we rake this opportunity to wish the people of angola well and once more to convey to them and all their leaders our willingness to contribute whatever we can to assist in the establishment of a permanent peace and the strengthening of the democratic order', 'we will continue to make our contribution to the strengthening of the oau which remains an important instrument that we all need to address the serious concerns of the peoples of our continent', 'we also hope to conclude our negotiations with the european union as soon as possible to strengthen our economic and other relations with this important group of countries in a manner that does not disadvantage any other country', 'in a fortnight will also be established the joint south africa  united states commission which will supervise the important process of strengthening the relations between ourselves and the united states of america', 'in a few days the prime minister of sweden will arrive in this city', 'we welcome this visit by the leader of one of the scandinavian countries all of which played such an important role in the struggle for the emancipation of all our people', 'the visit also emphasises the positive manner in which our relations with the rest of the world are developing', 'it will be followed by other visits as well our own to other countries in the interest of our own development and in the interest of a better world for all peoples', 'this parliament has through death lost some of the best among us', 'these include firoza adam thomas nkobi and joe slovo', 'let the results of this second session of our democratic parliament serve as our salute to them and a tribute to their memory', 'i am certain you will not fail them', 'i have the honour to declare the second session of our democratic parliament open', 'thank you']"

land as a consequence of the unique circumstance arising out of the decision of the leading party in government to recall the former president', 'mine is a responsibility within a matter of a few months to lead the national executive in completing the mandate accorded the african national congress in the  elections and in laying the foundation for the postelection administration to hit the ground running', 'that we were able five months ago to ensure a seamless transition and continuity in the systems of government is thanks to the maturity of our constitutional system reflected in part in the cooperation of members of the executive  old and new  and the steady hand of our public sector managers', 'as we look back over the past fifteen years i wish to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of presidents nelson mandela and thabo mbeki and the many women and men who played their role in steering the ship of state under democracy in the executive and the administration the legislatures across the three spheres of government and the judiciary  driven by the desire to improve the quality of life of all south africans', 'above all i stand before you with pride and confidence that the south africa we celebrate today  worlds apart from the divisions conflict and exclusion of a mere  years ago  is a product of the labours and toils of south african women and men from all walks of life', 'these south africans represent the hope and resilience that characterise our nation', 'within the galaxy of outstanding south africans are members of our democratic parliament to whom we had the misfortune since last february to bid the final farewell', 'they include brian bunting billy nair ncumisa kondlo john gomomo joe nhlanhla cas saloojee john schippers and jan van eck', 'to these i would also like to add ms helen suzman a truly distinguished south african who represented the values of our new parliament in the chambers of the old', 'it is these and other patriots who should take the greatest share of the accolade when we pronounce that  whatever economic storms may pound our shores whatever political uncertainties may visit our collective consciousness in a transition  our nation is in a good state', 'however we should not underestimate the challenges we face', 'the global economic meltdown does pose serious dangers for our economy in terms of job losses and the quality of life of our people', 'naturally the uncertainties of a political transition can pose more questions than there are currently answers', 'as a consequence some of us may be mesmerised by the transient waves of stormy weather and hunch our shoulders in the face of these headwinds of economic turbulence and political tumult', 'but ours is a journey of hope and resilience', 'we may even say that in a strange quirk of fate many aspects of our constitutional order have been tested in the recent past  and everyone of them has passed the test to reveal a democracy that is exceptionally resilient', 'our democracy is healthy', 'it is steadily growing stronger underpinned by a constitution hardly equalled in the world', 'indeed the robustness of our political engagement during this season of electoral contest  which we all agree should be dignified and peaceful  is the surest guarantee of the continued survival and deepening of our democracy', 'it is south africas people who have ensured its progress  and it is they who shall secure our democracy in the years to come', 'allow me madame speaker and chairperson in this context to urge all eligible south africans to register and to vote in the coming national and provincial elections so that we can shape our destiny ourselves', 'this we should do every working day in the municipal offices before the voters roll is closed', 'but we should also take advantage of the special registration weekend arranged by the electoral commission of south africa the iec tomorrow and sunday the th and th of february respectively', 'i should also take this opportunity to indicate that i will in the next few days conclude consultations with the electoral commission and the provincial premiers and announce the date of the elections', 'honourable members   we owe our being as a democracy to the people of south africa who on  april  for the first time collectively took their destiny into their own hands', 'through that simple but profound act of casting a ballot for a government of all the people of our country we turned our backs on a past that dehumanised us all', 'it is therefore appropriate on this occasion to celebrate the th anniversary of the adoption of the declaration of the oau adhoc committee on southern africa on the question of south africa adopted in august   commonly known as the harare declaration', 'that initiative laid the foundation for global consensus through the united nations on the approach to negotiations in south africa', 'within south africa it also informed the content of the  conference for a democratic future  bringing together patriots from virtually all walks of life', 'all this led to the negotiations process which culminated in our first democratic elections in ', 'in this regard we should salute the late president of the african national congress oliver reginald tambo for initiating and piloting through continental and world bodies what became a compass for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in our country', 'that courageous step to devise a framework that would seek peace and reconciliation in the place of war and conflict reversed for good the false dawn of a hundred years ago that is the conclusion in  of the national convention which presaged the formation of the union of south africa', 'while that convention defined the territorial integrity of south africa as we know it today it was based on racial oppression and exclusion', 'and so  years into our democracy we can assert that the fear the insecurity and the loathing that  years ago generated an exclusive and illusory peace among colonial masters were not only unfounded  but truly misplaced', 'those fears and insecurities gave rise to decades of resistance', 'in this regard we salute that brave son of our people solomon kalushi mahlangu who went to the gallows  years ago with his head held high in the proud knowledge that his blood would nourish the tree of freedom', 'allow me to acknowledge lucas mahlangu brother of kalushi representing the mahlangu family', 'solomon mahlangu was continuing a tradition of the warriors of yesteryear among whom we count those under king cetshwayo who in  defeated the british army in isandlwana in defence of the freedom of the indigenous people of our country and the sovereignty of their lands', 'a hundred and thirty  years on we can only marvel at the hope and the resilience that infused those stout hearts', 'in the centres of learning the same resistance fuelled the rekindling of mass struggles during the cold winter after the banning of the liberation movement and the imprisonment of most of its senior leadership', 'a group of valiant students broke away from nusas to found the south african students organisation saso  years ago', 'within this generation are the early leaders of saso which included strini moodley professor barney pityana steve biko onkgopotse tiro harry nengwekhulu themba sono mapetla mohapi mosioua lekota johnny issel and mthuli ka shezi', 'for inspiring hope in a period of despair we salute them', 'in this regard we wish to acknowledge onkgopotse tiros cousin pat tlhagwana', 'in this context we also wish to acknowledge the late ephraim mogale the founding president  years ago of the congress of south african students cosas and his peers', 'in the towering memory of these students of yesteryear resides an abiding message that the thirst for freedom and knowledge burns even stronger in the bosoms of our youth', 'the message of their heroic deeds rings true today as it did those many years ago that we should together expand the frontiers of opportunity  that we should indeed in the words of the freedom charter open ever wider the doors of learning and of culture  we call to mind these organisations and leaders to emphasise the spirit of hope and resilience that infused the democratic struggle even when everything looked bleak  to underscore the responsibility that rests on our shoulders to advance the ideals that so many sacrificed for refusing to be cowed by setbacks and hardships', 'and so madame speaker and honourable chairperson we should ask ourselves how have our actions defined the path of south african societys evolution in the fifteen years since the birth of our democracy  and how have we advanced the cause of human development and human dignity since the  democratic mandate  we do have today a wellfunctioning democratic system based on principles of transparency and openness with numerous platforms for public participation and independent institutions mandated by the constitution to support democracy', 'over the years we have steadily improved the structures of governance', 'we have built a system of healthy intergovernmental relations across the spheres and improved integration within and among them', 'indeed government can be proud that we have changed the demographic composition of the public service which in virtually all respects approximates the character of our society', 'however while women constitute about  of all senior positions in the public service this falls short of the target of parity that we had set ourselves', 'at the level of the national and provincial legislatures indications are that the nation will this year surpass the  women representation level achieved in  and hopefully even the  achieved in the  local government elections', 'we hope that all political parties will as they finalise their electoral lists make their contribution to this noble endeavour  though some progress has been made at  the situation is less impressive with regard to people with disability employed in government measured against the  target we set ourselves', 'on both counts the private sector is lagging far behind', 'various measures have been put in place to improve the efficiency of the public service including financial management thusong service centres and other service delivery innovations izimbizo and as currently in the department of home affairs firm leadership', 'however much more needs to be done to improve the service culture and orientation of some public servants especially those at the coalface of direct interaction with the public', 'as honourable members will be aware our government has made the fight against corruption one of the core areas of focus', 'this is reflected among others in legislation rules and regulations governing public servants and political officebearers alike partnerships with civil society and the business community as well as anticorruption hotlines', 'it may as well be that the systems of preventing and punishing corruption are still inadequate  but from the point of view of government systems we can draw solace from the fact that over  of cases of corruption reported in the media become public because government has detected the wrongdoing and is in fact acting against it', 'the same challenges confront the private sector', 'in the end the challenge is as much about regulation  as it is about consistent enforcement', 'honourable members   i am certain that we are all agreed that the wellbeing of our society depends critically on the progress we make in expanding the nations wealth and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared by the people as a whole', 'it is common cause that after the economic stagnation of the late s and early s south africa has experienced the longest period of sustained economic growth since the recording of such statistics started in ', 'in the first decade of freedom economic growth averaged  per year and this improved to  per year on average from  to ', 'while the consumer boom impelled by rising employment and incomes and low inflation and interest rates played its part in this regard we are encouraged by the broad canvass of opportunities for further expansion going forward', 'these include in the first instance higher rates of investment by both the public and private sectors', 'in this regard some five years ago we were hovering around  of gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of gross domestic product gdp', 'such has been the acceleration in investment that today this figure stands at  closer to the  that we projected to attain only in ', 'this is in part a consequence of deliberate programmes by government to expand public infrastructure', 'it is also a result of policies to improve the climate for private sector investments  and to conduct fiscal and monetary policy in a manner that expands access to services and reduces the inflationary burden while at the same time ensuring macroeconomic stability and sustainability', 'the focus on microeconomic reforms in the past decade and the efforts especially since  more systematically to remove the variety of obstacles to growth have had a positive impact', 'it is in this context that the accelerated and shared growth initiative asgisa is being implemented ensuring that all the critical blockages such as infrastructure bottlenecks integrated industrial policy and programmes the skills challenge regulatory gridlocks and efficiency of government services are addressed in a focussed and systematic manner', 'our economy has become more open and since  it has steadily become integrated into the global system', 'our financial institutions are a force of good example which has somewhat sheltered us from the global economic storms', 'yet the extent of their reach within our society remains far below expectations', 'our economy remains largely reliant on mining and agriculture for exports', 'except for the services sector we have not seen a large enough expansion in critical sectors especially manufacturing', 'as such the rate of growth in exports has not been as high as in comparable countries', 'it is precisely this weakness which accounts for the large current account deficit particularly when we entered higher ranges of growth', 'and because we have a low savings rate we have had to rely on shortterm capital flows to finance the deficit as well as our investment programmes', 'these are challenges that our country will certainly have to address going forward', 'of critical importance is the question what in fact should economic growth be about', 'wealth is created in order to improve peoples quality of life', 'thus the question whether growth is equitably shared should form a central pillar of all our economic considerations', 'importantly sharing the benefits of growth should entail labourabsorption ensuring that there is decent work', 'indeed it is a matter of proud record that between  and  the economy created about oneandhalf million net new jobs  and even more remarkable about   jobs a year between  and ', 'in this latter period for the first time since the attainment of democracy more jobs were being created than the number of new entrants into the labour market thus reducing the unemployment rate from  in  to  in ', 'of course this should not detract from our obligation to continue interrogating the issue of the quality of these jobs including the rights and benefits that workers enjoy', 'sharing the benefits of growth should also include accelerated implementation of affirmative action including broadbased black economic empowerment', 'this is not in pursuit of a socalled racial agenda', 'in reality a country that does not ensure the involvement of all of its population at all levels of economic activity is certainly going to perform well below its actual potential', 'the fact that the private sector lags behind in changing the demographics of management and skilled occupations in enterprise development and so on in part makes our country a laggard in the high growth stakes', 'sharing the benefits of growth also means an efficient and equitable role for the state in using the fiscus as an instrument of redistribution and sharing the burden of providing public goods', 'honourable members will be familiar with most of the data on matters relating to the social wage', 'i will however cite a few instances again to sketch out the nature of the progress we have made and the challenges that we face', 'government is painfully aware that abject poverty is still too widespread in our society  and the level of inequality is too high', 'we have in the past  years done our best to attack this scourge through the social wage', 'to quote work conducted by a team of academics at the university of stellenbosch led by professor servaas van der berg  firstly moneymetric poverty declined substantially since the turn of the century', 'the reduction is to a large extent due to a dramatic expansion in social grants expenditure from  onwards', 'this improvement is mirrored in access to basic services  a rapid decline in asset poverty even preceded the decline in moneymetric poverty', 'secondly although the reductions in poverty have been substantial aggregate inequality increased during the s', 'thirdly the dynamics underlying the poverty and inequality trends determine the broad policy outlookppoverty has decreased since the transition but  inequality has not improved', '  poverty since the transition what we know p van der berg et al august   on a critical matter of detail the researchers further observe  among households that include children defined as those aged  and younger the number of households reporting that a child went hungry declined dramatically from just over  per cent to  per cent between  and ', 'this suggests that the poverty situation has improved remarkably particularly among people experiencing the greatest degree of welfare deprivation', 'the prevalence of hunger among children has virtually halved over four years', ' poverty since the transition what we know p van der berg et al august   indeed these observations are confirmed by our own research which shows that income poverty especially among african and coloured communities has declined partly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social grants', 'while the number of grant beneficiaries was million in  by  this had increased to million', 'this is largely a result of massive expansion in access to the child support grant which increased from thousand beneficiaries in  to million in ', 'as part of the contribution to the income of the poor the target for million work opportunities through the expanded public works programme was attained in  a year earlier than envisaged in the  electoral mandate', 'this has created the possibility massively to expand this programme and improve its quality', 'with regard to household access to basic services the figures speak for themselves', 'for instance access to potable water has improved from  in  to  in   electricity  to   and sanitation  to ', 'evidence of the social wage is also seen in massive improvements in access to primary health facilities', ' of south africans now live within  kilometres of a health facility  and we are informed that all clinics now have access to potable water', 'child immunisation coverage has steadily increased to about   and malaria cases have massively declined', 'we are also heartened that research into hiv prevalence demonstrates stabilisation and a slight reduction in rates of infection', 'further our antiretroviral treatment programme is not only the largest in the world  but it is expanding all the time with over   patients having been initiated on antiretroviral treatment since the commencement of the programme', 'yet many health facilities do not always have the required medicines appropriate staffing levels and constant supply of basic services such as clean running water and electricity', 'in some of these facilities management is poor and staff attitudes need improvement', 'in education we have seen a drop in the educator learner ratio  almost universal access in terms of enrolment at primary school level  and an improvement in the number of pupils passing mathematics to quote a few examples', 'at the same time much effort has been put into improving infrastructure in poor areas', 'of course we do know that the dropout rate particularly at secondary and tertiary levels is unacceptably high and the educational system has yet to produce the requisite kinds of skills needed by society', 'in addition trends in performance both in terms of teaching and learning show a worrying persistence of the social divisions of the past', 'ironically precisely where education is most needed to help break the cycle of poverty is where infrastructure administrative and teacher capacity are least impressive', 'governments social programmes have also improved the asset base of the poor in the form of housing  with million subsidised houses provided', 'we should of course acknowledge that the land redistribution programme as well as postsettlement support could have been handled faster and better', 'overall we are proud of the advances in our social programmes', 'but we cannot satisfy ourselves merely with quantitative change', 'be it in education health housing water or sanitation the central question that confronts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services on this we still have some way to go', 'honourable members   the scourge of crime remains a major source of insecurity for south africans', 'daily experience in poor and affluent neighbourhoods alike is one of apprehension at the possibility of violent attack', 'within public and private institutions the possibility of nefarious schemes siphoning off resources through corruption is always a source of great concern  of course the overall crime rate having peaked in  has consistently declined', 'all kinds of statistics can be cited to attest to this', 'but we do know that the reduction has not been fast enough not even at the  rate that we set ourselves for various categories of contact crime', 'the fact that incidents of violent robberies in households and businesses have been on the increase  and crimes against women and children have not abated in any significant measure is a matter of great concern', 'this points to weaknesses in our neighbourhoods especially in building the bonds of community solidarity that would assist us in preventing and combating crime', 'it points to systemic weaknesses in the criminal justice system from investigation of crimes to rehabilitation of offenders', 'it points to weaknesses in the efficiency of the court system both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management', 'these are the issues that the comprehensive revamp of the criminal justice system has started to address', 'yet in being brutally selfcritical we should not lose sight of the fact that what we are assessing is a system that enjoys by far better legitimacy than ever experienced in our country', 'this is because of the transformation these institutions have undergone in terms of their doctrines based on a human rights culture their demographic composition and their systems of accountability', 'but let us not delude ourselves as with the rest of our social life such transformation is still at its nascent stages', 'we still have a long way to go', 'i am certain that honourable members will agree that the humanity of our democratic dispensation should find expression in the extent to which we pay attention to the most vulnerable in society', 'in this regard we have through legislation international conventions regulations and campaigns ensured that concrete efforts are made to improve the conditions of children women people with disability and the elderly', 'through advocacy campaigns and indeed as a result of the partnerships we have built with organisations representing these vulnerable groups we have improved awareness around issues that affect them  and progressively encouraged the mainstreaming of these concerns', 'it is a matter of proud record that for instance femaleheaded households have received a biggerthanaverage share of the social wage including housing and health care  and that among the most successful programmes have been campaigns on child immunisation and nutrition', 'yet access to employment weighs heavily on rural women youth and people with disability', 'hiv impacts most severely on young women', 'violence against women and children is much too high', 'all these are assignments for the coming period', 'madame speaker and honourable chairperson   these then are some of the advances that democracy has brought  and the progress that government has made in fulfilling the mandate of the electorate', 'there is no gainsaying that by any measure the progress made since  has been impressive', 'but neither can there be doubt that the challenges remain immense', 'it is apt therefore to remind ourselves of that instructive observation of hope and resilience continuity and change by former president nelson mandela in his biography long walk to freedom  i have walked that long road to freedom', 'i have tried not to falter  i have made missteps along the way', 'but i have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill one only finds that there are many more hills to climb', 'i have taken a moment here to rest to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me to look back on the distance i have come', 'but i can rest only for a moment for with freedom comes responsibilities and i dare not linger for my long walk is not yet ended', '  in a few months from now the people of our country will pronounce on the leadership they prefer to carry forward the noble work of this great freedom fighter and other founders of our democracy', 'while our approaches may differ the objectives that we need to aim for are clearly and unambiguously set out in our constitution to create a united nonracial nonsexist democratic and prosperous society that plays a positive role in building a better world', 'six years ago leaders of our people came together in a growth and development summit and reached agreement on the tasks all of us should undertake to improve the quality of life of south africans particularly to halve unemployment and poverty by ', 'these include  creating more jobs better jobs and decent work for all through higher rates of investment public works programmes sector partnerships and strategies local procurement small enterprise promotion and support for cooperatives   addressing the investment challenge by improving savings appropriately deploying resources from pension and provident funds housing financial sector contributions and black economic empowerment   advancing equity developing skills creating economic opportunities and extending services  and  local action and implementation for development including provision of infrastructure and access to basic services', 'i am certain that as part of and in addition to these objectives south africans would hardly differ regarding the need to improve our education system  to provide efficient decent and equitable health care  to develop our rural areas and ensure food security  and to intensify the fight against crime and corruption', 'i cite these issues not because they are allencompassing nor that by identifying them we would cure all the ills of our society', 'rather i have chosen to do so to emphasise the point that south africa does not suffer the poverty of visions', 'our challenge is to translate these visions into programmes and projects for effective implementation', 'these ideals are shared by virtually all of humanity as reflected in the united nations millennium development goals', 'and yet humanity today faces the danger that the attainment of these objectives could be postponed by many years if not decades as a consequence of the economic crisis that has engulfed the global village', 'what on the surface started off as a financial crisis among a few lending institutions has exploded into a global credit crunch with severe consequences for actual production and trade', 'we can decry the greed the shorttermism and the carelessness of managers of big corporations which precipitated the crisis', 'we can condemn the policies of governments which took their eyes off the ball and allowed the rapacious licence of unregulated markets to wreak havoc on financial systems', 'we can do all this  and we will be perfectly justified', 'yet our central and immediate task is fully to appreciate the consequences of these developments on our own economy and our region and devise responses that will minimise their impact especially on the most vulnerable sectors of our society', 'what we do know is that the regulatory environment in our country and the countercyclical budget policies we adopted have helped us avoid the worst impact of the crisis', 'but we are all too aware that because we are strongly integrated into the world economy demand for our exports has declined  access to finance and inflows of capital have turned for the worse  lower demand has precipitated a scaling down of production  the creation of jobs is negatively affected and in some sectors retrenchment has become a reality', 'these difficulties have coincided with a period in which inflation and interest rates are still too high', 'our thanks to the governor of the reserve bank who yesterday announced a  reduction in the rate of interest', 'combined these developments bode ill for the revenues we need to expand the provision of services and to implement our infrastructure projects', 'as such we have been forced to tone down our forecasts in terms of growth and jobcreation', 'we know too that south africa is less severely affected than many other countries', 'indeed in a period in which others are experiencing or projecting recessions south africa and the rest of the continent are still poised for growth even if at a slower rate', 'in this regard honourable members i am happy to report that in the interactions between the presidency and leaders of various social partners we agreed jointly to devise interventions that would minimise the impact of this crisis on our society', 'the task team dealing with these matters is still hard at work  and the following broad categories of responses are under discussion  firstly government will continue with its public investment projects the value of which has increased to rbillion for the next three years', 'in this regard where necessary we will find creative ways to raise funds', 'this will include support by our development finance institutions and loan finance from international agencies as well as partnership with the private sector and utilisation of resources controlled by workers such as pension funds', 'secondly we will intensify public sector employment programmes', 'on the one hand plans to expand employment in sectors such as health social work education and lawenforcement agencies will continue', 'on the other we will speed up the introduction of the next phase of the expanded public works programme', 'thirdly mitigating actions can be undertaken within the private sector to counteract an excessive investment slowdown and unnecessary closures of production lines or plants', 'on its part government will adapt industrial financing and incentive instruments to help deal with challenges in various sectors and also encourage development finance institutions to assist firms in distress because of the crisis', 'alternatives to layoffs will be explored including longer holidays extended training short time and jobsharing', 'this will be combined with promotion of the proudly south africa campaign and stronger action on illegal imports', 'fourthly government will sustain and expand social expenditure including progressively extending access to the child support grant to children of  years of age and reducing the age of eligibility for old age pension to  years for men', 'in addition we will more widely utilise the social distress relief grant and food security measures specifically also to target those either unprotected by the unemployment insurance fund or who have exhausted their benefits', 'we shall also continue to pay special attention to the challenge of anticompetitive behaviour on the part of some of our corporations', 'in this regard we wish to commend the competition commission for the firm hand that they are showing to ensure that culprits are brought to book', 'we do hope though that civil society will enhance its own level of activism to ensure among other things that as input prices decline the benefit is felt by the population', 'these immediate measures will be informed by the principle of a countercyclical fiscal policy', 'however we will ensure that the levels of borrowing by government are prudent and sustainable', 'this also implies a rapid reduction in government debt levels whenever conditions turn for the better', 'our efforts will also be informed by the appreciation that measures to protect the environment and mitigate the impact of climate change can also contribute to jobcreation', 'both in the g meetings and other interactions in multilateral institutions our government has argued for appropriate and urgent interventions particularly in the developed countries whence the crisis originated and where it is most severe', 'we believe that the time has come to strengthen domestic regulation and supervision of the financial system  but beyond this that stronger surveillance and action on a global scale have become unavoidable and necessary', 'critically we should also safeguard the integrity of the world trade system complete the current negotiations on the doha round of world trade negotiations and ensure that development aid is not scaled down', 'the abiding lesson from this experience is that we need stronger partnerships among economic role players on a domestic and global scale not only to stem the impact of the crisis  but also to put in place measures that would obviate a recurrence', 'in our own country we will embark on these undertakings as part of the process of setting our society on a higher growth and development path', 'the length of time towards attaining a higher trajectory may have been stretched somewhat', 'but we are not in doubt that that moment will yet come sooner rather than later', 'in this regard how we position our country to take advantage of unique opportunities that have come our way will be of paramount importance', 'i refer here in particular to the fifa world cup in  as well as the confederations cup a few months from now', 'virtually all the projects and plans are completed or nearing completion  from stadia transport infrastructure security measures issues of accommodation to health and immigration plans  confirming the confidence of the global soccer fraternity that ours will be a truly successful tournament', 'and we believe that after five consecutive wins the national soccer team is now more confidently gearing itself to perform above expectations  but beyond this the true legacy of this spectacle will be in our ability to showcase south african and african hospitality and humanity  to change once and for all perceptions of our country and our continent among peoples of the world', 'that depends on all of us  and to that we can attach no price  we also wish in this regard to congratulate all our sporting teams which have asserted south africas pursuit of excellence over the past year', 'special accolades are due to our cricket team which has climbed to the apex of global rankings', 'we are of course rugby world champions  giniel de villiers and his team have won the dakar rally  our paralympians continue to do us proud  and our under soccer team did quite well in an extremely competitive environment', 'madame speaker and honourable chairperson     just two weeks ago south africa completed with mali part of the archives to preserve the ancient manuscripts of timbuktu', 'this rich heritage points to africa as a beacon of science and literature philosophy and commerce interrupted by the slave trade and the scramble for africas wealth', 'this initiative should spur us on to act in concert with other countries on our continent and further afield to better the human condition', 'indeed over the past  years we have spared no effort to ensure that africa experiences her renewal in what should in actual practice be the african century', 'steadily but surely our continent is progressing towards her renaissance with the interest of her people rising to the top of their leaders agenda asserting her hope and her resilience on the world stage', 'it is this and this alone that has informed our persistence in assisting the people of zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the crisis in that country', 'we wish in this regard to congratulate all the parties in zimbabwe for concluding negotiations delivering the ultimate prize that has always been the wish of the people of that country and the subcontinent as a whole that is a stable and legitimate government geared to address the challenges that the people face', 'we are truly heartened that yesterday the zimbabwean parliament passed amendment  of the constitution laying the basis for the installation of an inclusive government', 'special mention in this regard is due to sadc facilitator former president thabo mbeki and the team that tirelessly and patiently helped to bring the process to a successful conclusion', 'now the work of reconstruction can start in earnest  and south africa stands ready to assist wherever we can', 'in this respect there is urgent need to assist in dealing with the humanitarian crisis in that country', 'we are confident that because it cares the international community will partner the people of zimbabwe as they blaze out along a new trail', 'we are also encouraged that whatever fits and starts may seem to characterise the progress of the people of the democratic republic of congo on their march to stability and prosperity that progress is inexorable', 'the partnership built in the recent period between the leadership of the drc and rwanda holds out a promise for advances in matters of security and in dealing with the humanitarian crisis  but hopefully also with regard to political dialogue', 'in the same measure we will continue to work with other countries and the african union to pursue these objectives in burundi sudan western sahara cte divoire somalia and elsewhere', 'as would have been evidenced by various developments in the past few months south africa will use the privilege of chairing sadc to strengthen this critical regional institution with particular emphasis on implementing summit resolutions and cementing regional strategic cohesion', 'at the same time we will improve sadcs interaction with the common market of east and southern africa comesa and the east african community eac', 'these initiatives will be undertaken in order to extend rather than weaken the deep set of relations that we enjoy within the southern african customs union sacu', 'we wish on this occasion to extend our congratulations to the people and the leadership of zambia ghana and the united states of america for elections the symbolism of which transcends the narrow boundaries of their nationstates', 'we will as always seek to strengthen cooperation with these and other countries in pursuit of that which is good for humanity', 'we are privileged that this year we conclude celebrations of the first decade of our diplomatic relations with the peoples republic of china', 'over these years it has become clearer than ever before that there is much mutual benefit to be gained from our partnership', 'we also wish to affirm our commitment to the close relations that we have forged with brazil and india through ibsa  and indeed to the strengthening bonds that our country has been forging with russia and countries in asia the middle east as well as latin and north america', 'we have on countless occasions expressed our concern at the persistence of conflict in the middle east in general and in israel and palestine in particular', 'the depth of our disappointment at the recent escalation of the conflict and massive loss of life of especially civilians  including children women and the elderly  indeed defies description', 'there can be no justification for such acts of wanton destruction and savagery', 'and we do hope that this time round the renewed efforts of the international community to find a lasting solution to this conflict will bear fruit so israelis and palestinians can enjoy peace and security as neighbours within their sovereign territories', 'our special congratulations to the government and people of cuba on this the th anniversary of the attainment of their sovereignty and with it the freedom to choose their path of development', 'we were able in the past year to conclude further negotiations with the european union on our strategic partnership  and we do hope that the spirit which informed that engagement will prevail as we finalise the multilateral negotiations on the economic partnership agreements with countries in our region', 'we look forward to further strengthening this partnership when we host the south africaeu summit later this year', 'along with other countries of the south we will continue to pursue the cause of the restructuring of the united nations the international monetary fund and other multilateral institutions so they reflect the changed and changing global reality and operate in a democratic equitable and transparent manner', 'we also commit ourselves to meet the objectives of international agreements including the kyoto protocol and its successors for the benefit of future generations among our own people and peoples of the world', 'madame speaker and honourable chairperson   informing these our endeavours are two basic principles the need for us to complete the mandate accorded this government in   and the imperative to ensure that the government that comes in after the elections finds a ready platform to implement its programmes without undue delays', 'in the coming few months pending the national and provincial elections we will endeavour to complete that popular mandate', 'as part of the many detailed projects contained in the governments programme of action we will pay particular attention to  creating the capacity necessary for improved service delivery and better integration within and across the spheres of government including national strategic planning   continuing with the war on poverty campaign and finalising the draft of the comprehensive antipoverty strategy through the public consultations now under way   implementing the comprehensive programme we have put in place to eliminate the incidence of cholera in various parts of the country   continuing research and consultations on the comprehensive social security system including the matter of national health insurance   intensifying the campaign to save energy so as to manage the current difficulties and change our own behaviour while at the same time speeding up the projects to build new capacity and utilise alternative energy sources  recognising that in addition to the consequences of climate change resources such as fossil fuels and water are declining in the same measure as demand is increasing   integrating into the work of the relevant clusters the findings of research on second economy interventions such as the community works programme support for small and microenterprises and rural development initiatives   intensifying efforts to revamp the criminal justice system including better forensic capacity rapid increase in the number of detectives optimal utilisation of information and communications technology and better management of the courts  and  facilitating the processes aimed at strengthening the machineries dealing with matters of gender equality such as  representation in decisionmaking structures youth development the rights of people with disability and childrens rights  including completing consultations on the national youth policy preparing for the implementation of the african youth charter once it has been processed by parliament and for the setting up of the national youth development agency  submitting the sadc protocol on gender and development to parliament  strengthening advocacy on the rights of people with disability  and extending the number of municipalities that have set up childrens rights focal points beyond the current ', 'these and other programmes including the apex priorities identified in the state of the nation address last february form the bedrock of our efforts to conclude the popular mandate and lay the foundation for the future', 'we will intensify our efforts inspired by the enthusiasm the hope and the resilience of the south african people in pursuit of that which is good for all of us', 'this and this in the main is the source of our confidence when we say that the nation is in a good state', 'our democracy is healthy', 'it is steadily growing stronger', 'and so in the words of former president mandela we dare not linger for our long walk is not yet ended', 'i thank you']"

has given us life', 'in this she was echoing the feelings of millions including mama lenah ntsweni of mpumalanga who was the rnillionth person to receive safe and accessible water a few weeks ago', 'before we lose ourselves in detail important though it may be let us come back to the trends', 'the critical question is about a machinery which is improving its capacity to meet the needs of south africans', 'even where we might not have met our targets this is the question that we need to probe', 'such is the experience in the provision of subsidised housing', 'with thousand houses either built or under construction we do acknowledge that we shall not reach the target of one million that we set ourselves', 'but after the initial hiccups of the first two years we have now developed the capacity to build  houses every month', 'from the jobs summit new initiatives have emerged in a splendid partnership between business and government to start major projects that will put more roofs over the head of those in want', 'as this project starts unlocking the problem of limited public resources so will its beneficiaries multiply  from the supplier of building material to the small building contractor from the new employees to those who will occupy these dwellings', 'the construction of sports facilities reached new levels in  and the establishment of community arts centres

originally planned', 'in the area of welfare after the pain of restructuring the reach and the efficiency of delivery has improved  and rmillion is being saved a year by better management and eliminating corruption', 'the examples are many', 'but let us focus for a brief moment on two of the issues namely welfare and education', 'the savings that have been effected through tackling fraud should rightly contribute to an expansion of assistance to those in need', 'during this year of older persons all of us  and i do include myself  are especially aware of the needs of senior citizens', 'we are therefore pleased to announce that we are able once again to increase old age pensions  this year by  that is r  and the disability grant by the same percentage', 'regarding education why is it that the majority of south africans feel that things have improved in this area', 'this is because many of those who were studying under trees or in dilapidated buildings have benefited from the rbillion spent on the construction or renovation of  classrooms', 'it is because the doors of all public schools are open  it is because the higher education assistance scheme is reaching more students  it is because despite the setbacks of one or another year the matric results are improving', 'and even if this majority does not read or hear or see in the media the praise that is due when the matric examinations are conducted without a major incident they do not need to be told for they live these experiences', 'last year we made the observation that it was inexcusable that textbooks were not supplied within seven days of the beginning of the schoolterm many areas did meet this target', 'however many did not', 'we hope that this year the planning and funding will be settled earlier in the year', 'for if this does not happen after the pressured experiences of last year  if our administrations are unable to carry out such a straightforward project  then in the coming year

built through ordinary motions of government as we know it', 'i know deputy president thabo mbeki has taken this issue to heart that is how to restructure government with the prime objective of fulfilling peoplecentred functions rather than merely observing selfserving and archaic rules', 'such is the challenge in dealing with the difficult areas of crime and jobcreation', 'on both these issues there is naturally public impatience', 'so the question we need to ask is whether there is a possibility of a strategic and visible break with the perception of stagnation  it is not my task at this last sitting of parliament to set out medium and longterm programmes', 'but i feel more than confident to say that on both counts  with regard to crime and jobcreation  there is hope', 'what are the trends and concrete measures on crime', 'the statistics show that there has been a reduction or stabilisation in most serious crimes', 'murder for instance has declined by  since ', 'but the response is made that figures are meaningless in the context of peoples concrete experiences', 'a myriad of laws have been passed to narrow the space for criminals the latest among these being legislation on crime syndicates as well as minimum sentences and conditions on the granting of bail', 'but the response is that not enough criminals are being arrested and the quality of investigation is poor', 'a detective academy has been set up and the skills gathered here are starting to be felt in dealing with crime syndicates', 'and major steps have been taken to deploy police where they are needed most', 'but the response is where are the results  all these responses arise from a failure to appreciate the fact that turning the tide against crime cannot be achieved overnight', 'there are also deliberate efforts to sensationalise and politicise this issue', 'but we are the first to acknowledge that the impatience and dissatisfaction among ordinary people are justified', 'we can and shall break out of this bog', 'there is hope', 'examine the experience of the johannesburg central precinct and the durban beachfront where communities and businesspeople have joined with police and

this we salute the men and women in blue the overwhelming majority of them citizens of outstanding bravery and integrity  men and women who daily put their lives on the line so that the nation can enjoy security', 'above all the establishment of the office of the national director of public prosecutions and along with it the special investigation unit has already shown that a systematic approach to major crimes  combining intelligence professional investigations and prosecutions  is bound to bear fruit', 'and in expressing our appreciation to the intelligence services for their contribution in this and other areas to guarantee our peoples security i wish to join the public in saying more can be done  and more must be done', 'questions have been asked whether we have got the balance right between the rights of criminals and those of ordinary citizens', 'this government is not about to join the chorus baying for the death sentence or to reverse our human rights gains', 'yet in addition to the measures we introduced regarding bail and mandatory sentences we need to examine spaces that need tightening', 'for instance should interference with witnesses and murder of policemen and women not attract very harsh mandatory sentences', 'what about the form and content of evidence that should be given to defence attorneys in bail applications', 'for it does not help for the police to do their work and for the justice system to be efficient if criminals will subvert investigations and prosecution by violent and foul means', 'these are just some of the issues that need to be addressed along with and i should underline along with the plodding industry on all fronts which will take many years to bring crime down to acceptable levels', 'let me also briefly reflect on recent developments in cape town', 'without presuming any organisation or individual guilty there are some obvious things that cannot be concealed', 'firstly what started off expressly as a campaign against gangsterism has now become a violent and murderous offensive against ordinary citizens and lawenforcement agencies', 'secondly what is portrayed as moral and godinspired against oppression exploitation and imperialism has assumed the form of terrorism to undercut cape towns lifeline and destabilise a democratic government', 'thirdly what is undertaken as an expression of militancy could now very easily provide cover for rightwing counterrevolution against the new south africa', 'this campaign is rotten to the core  it is misguided  and its attempts to invoke religion is blasphemous', 'what south african indeed who owes loyalty to this country and this continent would engage in such callous deeds what fighter against crime would engage in a campaign that diverts resources of the police from dealing with criminals  i want to assure the people of cape town that we know who these people are  we know who trains and backs them  and steadily we are building watertight cases against them that will ensure that they stay in jail for a long long time', 'let me reiterate the battle against crime has been joined', 'and we have no doubts at all about who the victors will be', 'madame speaker   there is hope too in the area of jobcreation', 'for a start if economic growth last year and this year are less encouraging we are confident that this is an exception that confirms an otherwise upward trend', 'indeed in this era of volatility what we need to ask ourselves is why south africa did not experience the kind of paralysing turbulence that was the lot of most countries at our level of development', 'the answer is that our fundamentals are robust', 'local and foreign fixed investments are on the rise though not at the pace we would prefer', 'exports are increasing  and in some areas of agriculture for instance the increase has been by as much as ', 'steadily our economy is becoming more competitive', 'telecommunications and tourism are growing at an impressive rate  road construction and spatial development initiatives are expanding the economic base of regions that were ignored in the past  public works programmes have created hundreds of thousands of jobs though some of them are temporary', 'we have also taken impressive strides in the restructuring of state assets', 'and let us remind ourselves that some of the successes in the provision of services derive directly from this', 'we are determined to continue with this programme  but to do it in a way that is systematic and professional and benefits the people as a whole', 'this includes widening the base of ownership among others through the national empowerment fund', 'south africa did not experience what others did because we have credible and sustainable fiscal and monetary policies combining discipline and flexibility', 'despite the difficulties that we have experienced deriving from the global economy we have resolved that we shall not cut the social spending required to build a better life for all including the poverty relief programme that now runs into billions of rands', 'while strict econometric models may require certain fractions for a balance among indicators we shall continue to discuss realistic inflation targets and interest rates for a developing country like ours ', 'we shall not divert from the course of discipline  nor shall we as we said last year cut our noses in order to spite our faces', 'yet the public is within its rights to ask if all is well why is the economy shedding jobs is there hope', 'yes there is hope', 'many of the initiatives will take time to be felt in the lives of ordinary people', 'but there are immediate things that can be done', 'it was in recognition of this challenge that representatives of government labour business and communities came together last october to work out a concrete programme of action around this challenge of jobcreation', 'and we emerged from there confident of the future because we set out to build it together', 'among the decisions taken there some of them unprecedented in any country are   firstly the proposal of the trade union movement to mobilise all working people to dedicate one days pay to the projects meant to create jobs for our fellow citizens', 'and today i commit all ministers and deputy ministers in my government to take part in this initiative by contributing a days gross salary', 'we hope that all levels of government including parliament as well as public and private institutions will do the same', ' secondly the mobilisation by the business community of funds which should run into more than rbillion for special projects in tourism and skills development', 'we can take tourism beyond the impressive ', ' of gross domestic product that it has already achieved to create hundreds of thousands of jobs', ' over the next few years there will be a dramatic expansion of the existing rbillion government package of labour intensive programmes such as working for water land care municipal infrastructure and selected welfare projects', ' one major project on housing has already started where public and private funds will be pooled to start a process that will speed up housing delivery at the same time as it creates jobs', ' the umsobomvu trust which will be worth over a billion rand and which is aimed at creating jobs learnerships and business opportunities among the youth is one among projects many of which have been proposed by the youth themselves', 'together these major initiatives have the potential to change the face of south africa', 'and if we say there is hope in so far as jobcreation is concerned it is because we know that all the partners have put shoulders to the wheel to ensure that we succeed', 'in this context we should reflect on our achievements regarding the regulation of the labour market', 'i refer here to the labour relations basic conditions of employment and employment equity acts among others', 'liberation could not have meant otherwise to a working class that was divided by racial laws and sections of which were blocked by edict from advancing in the workplace', 'we cannot retreat from this achievement in human rights', 'that our trade union movement has initiated the kind of contribution to jobcreation that i referred to is testimony to the responsibility that goes with a sense of social belonging', 'notwithstanding these achievements if indeed jobcreation and ending poverty are among our primary challenges we must continually evaluate how our labour market policies and the rate of private investments among others facilitate the realisation of these objectives', 'this we must do in order to ensure that we achieve our common objectives', 'this hope that we have about the future honourable members and delegates derives also from the knowledge that this government is serious about utilising state structures for the benefit of the people', 'and this applies not only to the national sphere', 'if in the past the profile of provincial government was portrayed more in the mistakes they made  it is perhaps a reflection of great improvement in their work in the context of south africas news content that little is heard about most of them in the media', 'we referred earlier to management of the matric results some improvement in the supply of textbooks and the management of social security grants', 'in addition to all this shouldnt we all be proud as south africans that only two years after the introduction of mass allocations of funds to provinces we are able to achieve fewer overdrafts and deficits this is not merely a stroke of good fortune', 'it is a result of hard work  and congratulations go to these public representatives and administrations', 'last year we spoke of the need to cut expenditure on personnel as part of reducing a bloated civil service and changing its orientation', 'that commitment remains', 'the new civil service regulations based on each individuals output especially management rather than just observance of rules should see to the improvement of service to the public', 'much progress has been made towards comprehensive agreement on redeployment and retrenchment', 'logically this must be based on assessment of public needs and on the very objective of governance', 'but let us emphasise that none of the parties in these negotiations will or should be allowed to use these processes to delay decisive action on this issue', 'within local government there is steady progress in regularising finances in implementing povertybased assistance in setting up mechanisms reduce the number of councils', 'and there is now seldom need for national interventions to resolve unnecessary conflict between these structures and traditional leaders', 'but we must be honest and acknowledge that in many respects this level of government has often played itself out as an achilles heel of democratic governance', 'this is not for the lack of structures and rules', 'where this happens it has more to do with the behaviour and attitudes of cadres that all parties have deployed in these structures', 'it is a matter of the survival of democracy of the confidence that people will have in the new system that all of us should pay particular attention to this issue', 'the public is justified in demanding better service more respect and greater concern for their needs rather than selfaggrandisement', 'our hope for the future depends also on our resolution as a nation in dealing with the scourge of corruption', 'success will require an acceptance that in many respects we are a sick society', 'it is perfectly correct to assert that all this was spawned by apartheid', 'no amount of selfinduced amnesia will change this reality of history', 'but it is also a reality of the present that among the new cadres in various levels of government you find individuals who are as corrupt as  if not more than  those they found in government', 'when a leader in a provincial legislature siphons off resources meant to fund service by legislators to the people  when employees of a government institution set up to help empower those who were excluded by apartheid defraud it for their own enrichment then we must admit that we are a sick society', 'this problem manifests itself in all areas of life', 'more often than not it is business people who launder funds to curry favour with public servants  it is ordinary citizens who seek to buy themselves out of trouble  it is strange religious leaders who sing praises to criminals or hoard land acquired by the foul means of apartheid', 'all of us must work together for our redemption', 'many mechanisms have been put in place or strengthened to investigate and ensure proper punishment for these vile deeds the public protector the heath commission the auditorgeneral the office for serious economic offences to name but a few', 'within government more resources are being provided to allow them to do their work', 'and very practical resolutions emerged from the public sector anticorruption summit held last november', 'by the time we go to the national summit in march which will be informed by the decisions of the religious morals summit and the public sector conference all sectors of society including business and the trade union movement should have worked out concrete proposals to take this matter forward in a visible and meaningful way', 'it is commendable that the public service bargaining chamber has this week agreed on drafting new disciplinary mechanisms to facilitate dealing with cases of corruption mismanagement and incompetence', 'our nation needs as matter of urgency what one writer has called an rdp of the soul', 'when we succeed in changing our own way of doing things when we make progress in transforming society at all levels we shall not only be improving our own quality of life', 'we shall also be laying the basis for a future of hope for our children and grandchildren', 'we know too well that if there is a problem of unemployment it is the youth who bear the brunt of it', 'if there are high incidences of crime it is the youth who are misused as footsoldiers and consumers of illegal substances', 'if there is corruption and lack of morality it is they who suffer a warped upbringing', 'if we do not rid ourselves of the culture of violence it is the youth who will be infected with it', 'it is therefore encouraging that youth organisations have started to play a more visible role in initiatives such as the jobs summit and community service', 'we value the increasingly powerful role they are starting to play in the critical campaign against hiviaids', 'they do have the capacity to make a special contribution to breaking the silence which fuels this epidemic  as we shall all be doing during the coming national condom week when we focus on prevention', 'this leadership role by the youth reinforces my own hope in the future of our country and our nation', 'and i wish to all on all the youth of our country in their millions to recognise their civic duty in all spheres of life including taking part in exercising their right to elect a government of their choice', 'madame speaker   i referred at the beginning to the letters written by a notorious prisoner', 'in one of them he said  i am disturbed as many other south africans no doubt are by the spectre of a south africa split into two hostile camps blacks on one side', 'and whites on the other slaughtering one another  by acute tensions which are building up dangerously in practically every sphere of our lives', '  as i said earlier we have collectively managed the transition in a commendable manner', 'but it is matter of public record that elements of these divisions remain', 'we slaughter one another in our words and attitudes', 'we slaughter one another in the stereotypes and mistrust that linger in our heads and the words of hate we spew from our lips', 'we slaughter one another in the responses that some of us give to efforts aimed at bettering the lives of the poor we slaughter one another and our country by the manner in which we exaggerate its weaknesses to the wider world heroes of the gab who astound their foreign associates by their selfflagellation', 'this must come to an end', 'for indeed those who thrive on hatred destroy their own capacity to make a positive contribution', 'to the extent that the apprehensions about the meaning of democracy relate to real fears about matters such as language and culture we are proud that progress is being made towards the establishment of the commission on these and other issues so that all can feel secure as part of a united nation', 'to the extent that some of the apprehensions are imagined or based on opposition to change to that extent we are convinced that history will be the best teacher', 'we hope though especially as we go into the election campaign that real leaders will emerge who base their messages on hope rather than fear  on the optimism of hard work rather than the pessimism of armchair whining', 'dealing with these challenges also means accepting the facts of our history', 'as i said when i received the trc interim report last october the government accepts it with its imperfections', 'we recognise that it is not a definitive or comprehensive history of the period it was reviewing  neither was it a court of law', 'it was an important contribution on the way to truth and reconciliation', 'the critical act of reconciliation to come back to the letters i referred to earlier is the dismantling of what remains of apartheid practices and attitudes', 'reconciliation without this major step will be transient the ode of false hope on the lips of fools', 'it will therefore be critical that when we go into the detail of the trc reports recommendations in the coming period we must elaborate concrete plans about how together we can make practical contributions', 'this applies particularly to reparations not so much to individuals but to communities and the nation as a whole', 'let me reiterate that we shall all assist that process of nationbuilding and reconciliation reconstruction and development by protecting the institutions which guarantee the checks and balances that make social and political aberrations impossible', 'our word of acknowledgement to the human rights commission the gender commission and others for the sterling work they are doing to strengthen democracy', 'we should also underline that while it is a matter of design rather than accident that our social programmes for the poor impact most significantly on the lives of women this is but a small element in dealing with gender relations', 'need we remind ourselves that the greatest number of violent crimes that we have referred to take place in the home and mostly against women need we remind ourselves of the various forms of discrimination that still exist in the workplace schools places of worship and other social activity  but we should also derive pride that never in the history of this country has any government done so much to improve the status of women  black and white and this with their active participation  the institution of the independent judiciary has been throughout these first years of our freedom been a fundamental pillar of our democracy', 'and it continues to be', 'it is matter of great pride that we have established a dispensation in which noone not even the president is above the law', 'and for this we owe thanks to the men and women of integrity who serve in this institution', 'another pillar of our democracy is the independent electoral commission  and we respect it as we do all the others', 'like all other such bodies it is being assisted in various ways in accordance with the mission set out in the constitution and what the country can afford', 'i should indicate that after rational discussion agreement was reached that the iec should be allocated more than rmillion in additional funds in the coming budget year further to enable it to fulfil its functions', 'for the work that it has done to register potential voters the iec deserves our encouragement', 'but it is you the citizen who has to come out voluntarily to register and take part in south africas governance', 'we urge those who have not registered to do so without delay', 'democracy needs your voice', 'because of the impediment placed before us by some of the parties in this parliament i am unable to formally announce the election date', 'it is the insistence that we retain the option contained in the constitution for premiers to announce their own election dates  and not any reluctance on the part of the president  that this matter cannot be settled here and now', 'i am however able to give the indication after extensive consultations that we aim to select a day for our second national election in the period between the  h and h of may', 'honourable members and delegates   if we dare ourselves to succeed in this endeavour it is because the benefit will be primarily ours', 'but there is a sense in which it will be for all humanity the majority of whom took part in efforts to help us achieve our democracy', 'naturally southern africa is our most critical point of reference', 'as we progress towards social and economic integration in the region we are guided by the need to reverse the legacy of our past in the form of a trade balance skewed in south africas favour', 'the renegotiation of the southern african customs union and the progress towards a sadc free trade area slow as they may seem to outside observers are making progress along a path that is rneaningful and sustainable', 'amongst the many concrete symbols of the integrated reconstruction of our region is the progress towards the establishment of a southern african electricity power pool coordinated from harare which will also augment the regions power from the rehabilitated cahora bassa project', 'these firm steps towards integration are part of the renewal of our continent an african renaissance campaign which is growing to become a continental movement', 'our celebration of the millennium must reinforce this campaign and draw our artists intellectuals and journalists more actively into this enterprise', 'sports events such as the africa games in greater johannesburg this spring and the african cup of nations in zimbabwe next year should form part of this celebration of africas rebirth', 'fundamental to our success in generating this rebirth is to root out the causes of conflicts which are ravaging parts of the continent', 'it is with great concern that we see angola once more threatened with allout war', 'we do ask ourselves whether the time has not come to draw basic lessons from this experience to pose the question whether the united nations approach has been what is required of a situation in which one party rejects the results of a free and fair election', 'in the democratic republic of the congo we do welcome the growing realisation that political inclusivity in transition is one of the solutions required', 'there can be no winner in the military contest  there can only be untold suffering to the african people', 'further afield we remain hopeful that the protracted conflicts and the terrible suffering of civilians in countries such as sierra leone somalia and the sudan will be brought to an end', 'and looking beyond our continent we join all humanity in calling for a speedy resolution of the problems in the middle east and in east timor', 'if i may i would like to say a few brief words on lesotho', 'there is no doubt that sadcs collective initiative succeeded in creating the space for this countrys political leaders to find a peaceful resolution of their differences  and we ought to take this opportunity to congratulate the botswana and south african defence forces on their decisive contribution  and to pay tribute to those who lost their lives', 'we wish to assure members of our defence force that the nation is behind them in their endeavours be it in the fight against crime in peacekeeping operations or in their calm and professional assistance to voter registration', 'we remain as committed as ever to equip the force in a manner that ensures its effectiveness and adds value to the economy', 'the building of our region and the renewal of our continent to which we have referred in turn form part of the broader movement of developing countries to eradicate poverty and overcome the historical imbalances between north and south', 'the successful nonaligned movement summit in durban last year has brought south africa the opportunity to assist in asserting the interests of the developing world on serious issues facing humanity', 'amongst the most pressing of these is the debt burden as well as the need to bring under control the vast movements of capital which wash across the globe without much social benefit and with the capacity to undo years of industrialisation where it is most urgently needed', 'the initiatives under discussion to manage these rampant effects of globalisation including unfair protectionist measures in some industrialised countries require the reform of bretton wood institutions and even more critically the united nations security council in conformity with the democratic ethos of our age', 'we are encouraged that more and more nations are starting to recognise not only the need for this but its urgency as well', 'we are proud as a country that over the last fourandhalf years we have broadened our relations with developing countries of asia  now the second largest bloc with whom we trade  as well as latin america across the atlantic', 'our strategic location places us well to act as a bridge linking these two important regions and the african continent', 'we scarcely need to add that this burgeoning of our links with the countries of the south is not in opposition to the our relations with japan the united states europe including russia or the new strategic partnership we are building with the peoples republic of china', 'on the contrary they serve to enlarge the possibilities for truly equitable partnerships of mutual benefit to all our peoples', 'for a country that not many years ago was the polecat of the world south africa has truly undergone a revolution in its relations with the international community', 'the doors of the world have opened to south africa precisely because of our success in achieving things that humanity as a whole holds dear', 'of this we should be proud', 'madame speaker   as we reflect on the years of transition and beginnings of transformation we have cause to draw inspiration from what south africans can do', 'we dare to hope for a brighter future because we are prepared to work for it', 'the steady progress of the past few years has laid the foundation for greater achievements', 'but the reality is that we can do much much better', 'in the discussions that i have had with deputy president mbeki we have posed to ourselves the question whether we should be satisfied with steady progress', 'is south africa not capable of breaking out of the current pace and moving much faster to a better life', 'as the deputy president has often said the policies we have accord with the needs of the moment', 'there is no need to change them', 'yet the speed and style of implementing them can be improved', 'there are a few ingredients to this that need further attention', 'to elaborate on some of them  the first ingredient is partnership if we examine the major successes that have been made this year in addressing the most serious problems we face one factor stands out above all others and that is partnership among various sectors of society', 'the jobs summit the new aids awareness campaign the summits on morality and corruption and the issue of security in the farming communities are concrete examples from recent months', 'so too was last years successful masakhane focus week', 'and it is in this spirit that we shall on freedom day announce this years winners of the presidents award for community initiative', 'these initiatives have resulted in major advances as society mobilises handinhand with government to tackle the issues head on', 'as such one of the launching pads to faster progress has to be the mobilisation of south african society to act in unison on critical issues facing the nation', 'the second element is discipline  the balance between freedom and responsibility quite clearly there is something wrong with a society where freedom is interpreted to mean that teachers or students get to school drunk  warders chase away management and appoint their own friends to lead institutions  striking workers resort to violence and destruction of property  businesspeople lavish money in court cases simply to delay implementation of legislation they do not like  and tax evasion turns individuals into heroes of dinnertable talk', 'something drastic needs to be done about this', 'south african society  in its schools and universities in the workplace in sports in professional work and all areas of social interaction  needs to infuse itself with a measure of discipline a work ethic and responsibility for the actions we undertake', 'thirdly and related to the above is the question of reconstruction of the soul of the nation the rdp of the soul by this we mean first and foremost respect for life  pride and selfrespect as south africans rather than the notion that we can thrive in senseless selfflagellation', 'it means asserting our collective and individual identity as africans committed to the rebirth of the continent  being respectful of other citizens and honouring women and children of our country who are exposed to all kinds of domestic violence and abuse', 'it means building our schools into communities of learning and improvement of character', 'it means mobilising one another and not merely waiting for government to clean our streets or for funding allocations to plant trees and tend schoolyards', 'these are things that we need to embrace as a nation that is nurturing its new patriotism', 'they constitute an important environment for bringing up future generations', 'they are about the involvement of south africans in building a better life', 'thus we shall take not just small steps but giant leaps to a bright future in a new millennium', 'as we confounded the prophets of doom we shall defy todays merchants of cynicism and despair', 'we shall as we said in those letters of ten years ago fully dismantle apartheid and achieve true reconciliation', 'our hopes will become reality', 'the foundation has been laid  the building is in progress', 'with a new generation of leaders and a people that rolls up its sleeves in partnerships for change we can and shall build the country of our dreams']"

mecs traditional leaders representatives of local government president mandela and mrs machel your excellencies ambassadors and high commissioners distinguished guests fellow south africans  decisionmakers across the globe have accepted the reality that the global struggle to eradicate poverty and underdevelopment is fundamental to the wellbeing of human society', 'we know this as a matter of fact that the struggle to eradicate that poverty and underdevelopment in our own country is fundamental to the achievement of our own national goal to build a caring and peoplecentred society', 'of decisive importance to the millions of our people and the future of our country as we meet here today the central question we will have to answer at the end of the day is whether what we are doing as the legislature the executive and the judiciary as well as the fourth estate civil society is helping to lift from the shoulders of our people the intolerable burden of poverty and underdevelopment', 'this fourth opening session of our second democratic parliament including the debate that will take place next week must answer this question in a frank honest and forthright manner', 'what i know and can say without any equivocation is that during the past year our country has in real terms and within its means moved further forward towards a society free of poverty and underdevelopment', 'this i will also say that we are nowhere near liberating millions of our people from these scourges', 'but i will also say this that gradually step by step we are progressing towards the achievement of the historic goal of the eradication of a centuriesold legacy of colonialism of racism and apartheid', 'this i will also say that the overwhelming majority of our people consider themselves as actors in the unfolding and measured drama of the eradication of that legacy', 'madame speaker our deputy president the honourable jacob zuma is not with us today because he had to attend a summit on nepad in france at the invitation of president jacques chirac', 'at the end of the summit he will proceed directly to dakar senegal for another summit with prime minister tony blair', 'accordingly madame speaker i am honoured to convey an apology for his unavoidable absence today', 'we wish madame speaker also to acknowledge the presence of mrs rebecca kotane on this occasion of her th birthday and also mrs nontsikelelo biko in this year when we commemorate the th anniversary of the assassination of steve biko', 'madame speaker scientists say that anatomically modern humans people who look like us evolved in africa about  years ago and then slowly spread out to occupy most of the globe', 'they say that a key question has been when and where did these people first become modern in their behaviour', 'until now archaeological evidence has pointed to europe as the centre for this development about  years ago', 'the markers for modern behaviour include the production of art bone tools and a capacity for symbolism', 'lack of evidence of these behaviours suggested that people in africa lagged behind those in europe', 'remarkable new finds by south african archaeologists at blombos cave in the southern cape indicate that the prehistory of africa and its people now needs rewriting', 'blombos cave has produced evidence that african people were producing exquisite bone tools and delicatelymade stone spear points more than  years ago', 'but the most spectacular find is a slab of ochre engraved with abstract designs  years ago', 'described by the south african museum as the worlds oldest art object this invaluable slab of ochre is on display in this case here next to this podium an example of the extraordinary heritage of the evolution of humanity that resides within our country and which we must preserve', 'the designs on the slab were made deliberately and with symbolic intent', 'the scientists say that it is now to africa that we look for the origins of the human imagination and human ingenuity and for the genesis of art', 'we thank the south african museum for lending us this exhibit for a few hours as well as the presiding officers for agreeing that it should be brought into the chamber', 'i am especially pleased to welcome to our parliament prof chris henshilwood who led a team of scientists that found the blombos engraving', 'all of us are committed to do everything we can to support our scientists who are working selflessly to unravel the mysteries of the evolution of humanity', 'we also look forward to parliaments own millennium project which aims to collect collate and interpret our diverse heritage so that we may build a common identity and nationhood', 'we meet here at the beginning of a year during which our country will host two important summit meetings that are of great significance to africa and the world', 'these are the founding summit meeting of the african union in july and the world summit for sustainable development in augustseptember', 'in addition to launching the african union au the first of these summits will among other things take important decisions about the critical issues of peace and stability on our continent good political governance and good economic governance', 'it will also have the possibility to consider specific and implementable nepad development programmes whose central objective is the elimination of poverty and underdevelopment on our continent', 'the johannesburg world summit for sustainable development the largest highlevel international gathering this year will also focus on the critical matter of development and the eradication of poverty', 'this is of fundamental interest to our country our continent and the rest of the developing world', 'it will build on what was agreed at the historic united nations millennium summit of the year  and the monterrey mexico conference next month which will discuss financing for development', 'the nations of the world elected to come to our country because they understand and appreciate what we have done in the last sevenandahalf years to address within our own borders precisely the same questions that constitute the global agenda', 'they chose to convene in south africa because they are convinced that we have something of value to contribute to the building of a new and more equitable world order that must surely emerge', 'the recognition by the peoples of the world of the fact that we have established ourselves as a winning nation as a people determined to succeed places an obligation on us in fact to succeed', 'today millions of our people ask themselves the question  how can i lend a hand in the national effort to build a better life for all  during our recent visit to new york to participate in the proceedings of the world economic forum we had the privilege to meet south africans who live in or have become citizens of the united states', 'these are marco piovesan who lives in atlanta georgia and cathy gorille who lives in seattle washington', 'they and their friends all born in south africa have also been asking themselves the question  how can we who reside in the united states lend a hand in the national effort to build a better life for all south africans  from across the atlantic they have decided to make their own contribution to the common national effort by concentrating their resources and expertise in a programme for the reconstruction and development of our country', 'correctly and interestingly they have entitled their programme  vuk uzenzele  which idiomatically might be expressed as arise and act  the call they have made applies to each one of us as we review a year in which we called for unity in action among all south africans for change', 'it is an abiding challenge as we set out the programme of government for the coming period', 'on the occasion of our address to the joint sitting of our two houses of parliament last year we set out a programme of action focused on taking us further forward on the road towards a better life for all our people', 'the programme as further elaborated by ministers in their addresses to parliament and their public briefings was concrete', 'where possible we indicated the time frames within which particular actions would be undertaken', 'and so the time has come to account', 'a few weeks ago we received an unsolicited report from a team of academics at the university of stellenbosch led by professor willie esterhuyse which comments on our governments performance during the course of the year ', 'having studied the programme government set itself at the beginning of the year the team undertook a systematic analysis of what had been done to implement this programme', 'this is what the team says  the president made  promises in his speech', 'by  january   eleven months after the speech was made   of these have either been achieved or are credibly in progress', ' have not been achieved', 'that gives a ratio of  items of progress versus one item not yet completed', 'on a further  we do not have sufficient information to make a call', ' vs', ' is in our opinion a very good performance', 'governance is not about pushing buttons and things happening instantaneously', 'various obstacles like inertia vested interests competing agendas lack of capacity and the like must be overcome', 'from various speeches and press releases it is clear that ministers are working towards the goals set by the president', 'looked at closely there is coherence and a sense of purpose and integration', 'some of the  of items not yet achieved are those with a very large impact on the economy and society like the telkom ipo clarity on telecommunication issues and an effective campaign against aids', 'we have taken a hard line and suggested that these have not been achieved although government can certainly argue that they are in progress', '  the team then explains why in its opinion things do not look and feel better as they put it despite the progress that has been achieved', 'in its view firstly this is because communication by government is not always optimum', 'secondly it is because despite a lot of good progress on macro issues that are vitally important these are far removed from the person in the street', 'we should also submit that looking back at  the very solid progress recorded has been overshadowed by developments in zimbabwe and around hivaids', 'as government and even as members of parliament we may not agree with some or other part of these comments', 'but there is no gainsaying the fact that the analysis provides a fair assessment of governments work in the past year', 'and as the team says the national successes are cause for celebration', 'overall we should all be proud that steadily our country is moving away from the past of racism poverty conflict and economic stagnation', 'the weaknesses pointed out by the stellenbosch researchers reflect a variety of limitations in the structures and systems of government that should be put right', 'we can proffer a host of cogent reasons for these and other shortcomings', 'but to the extent that we have the capacity to do something about the problems we should and do take responsibility as government', 'i would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude and thanks to professor esterhyuse and the team for an informative honest frank and dispassionate assessment of the work of government', 'besides putting the resources of the university at the disposal of the nations current endeavours there is an important moral to this initiative', 'without being asked by anybody in government in a very practical manner the stellenbosch team answered the question  how can i lend a hand in the national effort to build a better life for all  madame speaker chairperson the past year has brought to the fore many patriotic south africans who have found a practical answer to this question', 'these include the school principal at sandi secondary school near umtata bongi peyana who put in an extra effort to raise a derelict institution towards the highest summits of success in teaching and learning', 'they include ivan booth a young south african who after numerous debates with his peers about the opportunities that democratic south africa offers to all its people decided to draft a manuscript for a publication entitled south africa reasons to stay', 'ivan says the book is dedicated  ', 'to the nation that won its place in history', 'he nation with the brightest future', 'the nation that fights and wins', 'the nation that doesnt know how great it is', 'in a postscript to his foreword this young and proud south african reports  several people have mentioned that anyone publishing such a book is effectively pushing themselves into a corner should they ever wish to leave south africa', 'hell yes', 'but what a corner', ' i trust the presiding officers will excuse the language', 'these heroes who are lending a hand to make south africa succeed include the children of the inkonjane senior phase school in soweto who in partnership with the sunday times volunteered their time and meagre resources to help fellow children in rural ingwavuma kwazulunatal affected by aids and illhealth', 'they include the people of rockville soweto who during the course of last year strengthened their cooperation with the police service and have as a result reduced crime in their area by half in ', 'these and many other south africans are the true leaders and heroes and heroines of the nation  the volunteers whose selfless dedication will ensure that we make progress to make ours truly a nation of hope', 'we have it within us as a nation to join them and many others to forge a massive movement of volunteers  dedicated workers in all fields of life  and bring to life those enduring attributes of all our people of perseverance and persistence in the struggle for our own good and the good of humanity', 'madame speaker chairperson the assessment of the stellenbosch team that we referred to earlier is that we are making progress as a nation in addressing the social backlogs that we inherited from the past', 'let us examine from data available in government what the trends are in this regard', 'in the five calendar years leading to the end of  three million south africans had been provided with access to clean running water through the community water supply project', 'in only three years since  four million more have been connected bringing the total to seven million', 'in the five calendar years to the end of   million electricity gridconnections had been made', 'in the three years since   million new connections had been made bringing the total to  million', '  hectares had been redistributed in the land reform programme in the five years to the end of   in the three years since then the number has increased by   hectares bringing the total to over one million hectares', 'the pace has dramatically increased in the case of land restitution with  claims settled at the end of   while by the end of  the total number of settlements has increased to  ', 'while the number of houses built or under construction was   at the end of the financial year in  the number currently stands at  million', 'these figures speak to the progress we are making in providing basic services to the majority of south africans', 'they add to the qualitative improvements in learning and teaching in our schools and the dramatic improvements in matric results which show that the transformation process is starting to bear fruit', 'the masses of our people both black and white both resident at home and abroad are like the peoples of the world driven by hope and confidence in our future as a country', 'they are determined to see our country progress refusing to demobilise themselves by succumbing to carefully cultivated pessimism and despair', 'as a government elected by the overwhelming majority of our people we have an obligation to respond to and sustain this hope and confidence in a rational realistic and a practical manner', 'as it must do the government has conducted its own thorough assessment of its own performance as well as the state of the nation', 'we have also studied carefully the findings and comments made by the academics from stellenbosch', 'we have also recalled our constitutional and legal obligations', 'we have also taken into account what the stellenbosch academics said that governance is not about pushing buttons and things happening instantaneously', 'the programme we will pursue this year builds on the foundations that have already been laid', 'it is informed by the broad objectives our country agreed upon in the context of the goal of reconstruction and development at the centre of which is the eradication of the legacy of poverty and underdevelopment', 'this year the government will work further to reduce the level of poverty in our society', 'this will be expressed in concrete timespecific programmes', 'this year the government will work further to develop our greatest resource our people including the working people the women the youth and the disabled', 'particular attention will be paid to such matters as health including aids education and training and the national youth service', 'this year the government will initiate additional programmes to improve the quality of life of all our people encompassing such issues as safety and security and moral renewal', 'this year the government will further intensify its attention on questions of social equity', 'this will include matters of black economic empowerment womens emancipation and justice for the disabled', 'and this year the government will further increase its focus on the issue of achieving higher rates of economic growth and development', 'this will include promotion of domestic and foreign investment trade promotion a social accord and the convening of a growth summit', 'this year building on the agreement we have reached with the public sector unions the government will work further to improve the efficiency of government', 'we will pay particular attention to such questions as improving professional competence at all levels of government radically to change the quality of service delivery', 'this year the government will take additional steps further to strengthen and entrench our system of democratic governance', 'this will include the appropriate celebration of the th anniversary of our constitution and the resolution of the various questions relating to cultural language and religious rights as well as the issue of the place and role of our traditional system of government', 'this year the government will work to discharge its current international responsibilities', 'this will include the hosting of the summit conferences to which we have referred to and other tasks that relate to specific instances including the situation in the middle east as well as the fight against terrorism', 'finally this year the government will work further to strengthen its links with the masses of our people', 'accordingly we will participate in encourage and promote the involvement of as many of our people as possible in the peoples campaign vuk uzenzele in this context we will strive to give real meaning to the strategic challenge facing the public service  batho pele  in pushing back the frontiers of poverty we shall do this in partnership with many in our society who are ready to lend a hand in the national effort to build a better life', 'let us cite some of the tasks in this regard', 'we need massive mobilisation around registration for social grants', 'government paid out  million grants in november  and the number increased to  million by november  the greatest increase being in child grants', 'in its programme for the mediumterm government had targeted the registration of three million children eligible for a grant by ', 'as a result of better awareness and improved efforts by the public service we are on course to meet this target by the year ', 'government will in the next few weeks approach religious bodies trade unions traditional leaders youth structures civic associations womens organisations and others for all of us to lend a hand so that in the next three years we register all who are eligible for the child grant and other social allowances', 'with each one of us lending a hand we can attain this and further ensure that we not only improve the integrity of the system against corruption but also that new registrations are conducted in reasonable time', 'i would like to add that as the minister of finance will elaborate in the budget speech we shall this year increase allocations to both old age pensions and child grants by far more than the rate of inflation', 'this call for a national partnership in support of the beneficiaries of social grants and the increases we have referred to underline the commitment of this government to improving the conditions of the most vulnerable sectors of our population', 'the plight of the poor is at the top of our agenda', 'again as part of our work to push back the frontiers of poverty and expand access to a better life possibilities have been created for further tax cuts particularly for the lower end of the salary scale a critical contribution by government to higher real wages for our workers', 'preserving and developing our human resources is a matter that all of us should pay particular attention to both individually and collectively', 'government has implemented the human resource development programme conscious of the fact that it is the surest guarantee to sustainable employment and economic growth', 'tens of thousands of trainees have benefited from this ranging from science and mathematics teachers agricultural inspectors information and communications technology learnerships to retrenched mineworkers and so on', 'this work will be intensified during the course of this year', 'studies that we have conducted in our interaction with the presidential ict councils whose establishment we announced last year have shown that a critical and pervasive element in economic development in the current age is the optimum utilisation of information and communications technology', 'in addition to the many programmes we have introduced in this area including telecentres we shall as a matter of urgency complete the work towards the establishment of an ict university', 'microsoft informed me last week that it would donate all the software needed in the   public schools', 'the implementation of the national plan for higher education will gain momentum in the coming months  and government is under no illusion that the process will be easy', 'we are confident though that working in partnership with higher education institutions we shall fashion a system that will ensure that we meet the challenges of the modern world', 'again in the spirit of vuk uzenzele we must arise and act in partnership across the nation and ensure proper teaching and learning in our schools', 'government will in the current mediumterm expenditure period allocate the necessary resources to ensure that no child studies under a tree', 'consultations will be held with provincial administrations to ensure that this programme is put in place as a matter of urgency', 'further through the communitybased public works programmes it should be possible to allocate resources for massive restoration projects in our schools clinics hospitals and other amenities across the country', 'the gauteng province informs us that r million over three years has been allocated for this purpose already', 'as we push back the frontiers of poverty the integrated rural development and urban renewal programmes assume critical importance', 'work has started in all the  rural nodes identified last year with integrated programmes ranging from community production centres multipurpose community centres social infrastructure projects and others being laid out', 'in the urban nodes business plans have been finalised and a number of projects are already being implemented', 'particularly in rural areas emphasis will be laid on ensuring food security and communitybased jobcreation projects so as directly to address the state of poverty in which communities live', 'consolidating this integrated work in the nodes already identified will be the focus of governments work this year', 'this will then lay the basis for the extension of the nodes to other parts of the country in the near future', 'we intend within the next three years to complete the land restitution process which is a critical part of our land reform programme', 'in each province of the country intense water and sanitation programmes are being implemented to improve hygiene with emphasis on schools and choleraaffected localities in kwazulunatal and the eastern cape', 'though we have contained the worst impact of this

positively indeed', 'the work that is being done by various institutions within or related to government on the health profile of the nation  the burden of disease regional and local trends mortality statistics and so on  is critical in fashioning a comprehensive response both in the public and private sectors', 'in addition to the many campaigns to change our lifestyles for healthier living the focus of our programmes in the coming period will be the improvement in quality of services in public health system', 'with regard to aids in particular our focus remains a massive prevention campaign directed at ensuring that the high rates of awareness translate into a change of lifestyles  care for the affected and infected  treatment of all diseases including those associated with aids  and research into a vaccine', 'this programme has been described by the head of unaids dr peter piot as the largest and most comprehensive in africa and one of the largest in the world  a programme he says with very high levels of government investment which is starting to show results', 'proceeding from the accepted premise that there is no cure to aids we are convinced that besides the individual and collective responsibility for us to take care of our own lives protection and enhancement of the immune system is a critical intervention in both the prevention and management of aids', 'by implication therefore poverty reduction and appropriate nutrition constitute an important front in this campaign', 'at the same time continuing work will be done to monitor the efficacy of antiretroviral interventions against mothertochild transmission in the sites already operational and any new ones that may be decided upon', 'our partnership across society should advance these multiple interventions required for us to deal with this epidemic', 'any focus on one issue at the expense of the others may have the effect of undermining what we all seek to achieve', 'honourable members last december the south african police service released comprehensive statistics on the incidence of crime in our society and the trends that attach to the rates of various forms of crime', 'it is our hope that honourable members and the whole of our society including the media will continue to apply their minds to the issues raised in that briefing the better to appreciate the role that society as a whole needs to play in dealing with this scourge', 'indeed when impassioned calls were made for the release of statistics we believe the aim was not to check whether government is delivering as it is said but to ensure that all of us lend a hand in the effort to combat and prevent crime', 'the simple fact that most of the crimes of assault and murder happen between friday and sunday among people who know one another and with many of them under the influence of alcohol or drugs speaks to the critical importance of community organisation and systems of social censure', 'clearly many of these crimes as well as those related to rape domestic violence and child abuse cannot be policed with any measure of success by the security agencies acting alone', 'credit is due to the thousands of south africans who have joined the community police forums and our police service as reservists', 'together if each one of us lends a hand we can do much better', 'during the month of february communities and their organisations have mobilised to enlist more volunteers', 'sustained throughout the year and with each one making a contribution we can surpass the   target set by the police service', 'the police and the department of justice will continue their interaction with communities and organisations to ensure that particular attention is paid to assisting in such areas as clerical work in police stations as well as in the courts so we are able massively to reduce the backlog of cases pending trial', 'legal and other professionals students and other sections in our communities can play an important role in this regard', 'having set itself the target of stabilising  police station areas where over  of crimes are committed within three years our security agencies have managed to attain this in one year', 'more attention in the coming period will also be paid to improving the intelligence capacity of our security agencies particularly to build on the successes that have been made in dealing with organised crime', 'as we said earlier these trends in crime incidents as well as other problems within society including whitecollar crime call for partnership across society to improve our moral fibre to strengthen community bonds to pull together in the direction of hope and success', 'consultations have started with various organised formations to convene a moral regeneration summit as a matter of urgency', 'such a summit should address the issue of the responsibility that each and all of us should take for our lives moving from the understanding that as we were our own liberators in resistance against apartheid so too should we today act as our own liberators in dealing with this legacy', 'moral regeneration also means inculcating in us and our youth that service to the people selfless commitment to the common good is more valuable than selfish pursuit of material rewards', 'productive investment is more valuable than aimless gambling in markets for derivatives', 'payment for honest work is more fulfilling and sustainable than theft', 'children and women are there to be respected not to become targets of abuse', 'as part of the peoples campaign vuk uzenzele we must intensify our work on the questions of social equity', 'we do this as a continuation of our struggle and in order to fulfil the commitments made with the rest of humanity at the world conference against racism that we had the honour to host last year', 'in this regard we must ensure that we accelerate and entrench the forward march of womens emancipation in all spheres of our lives', 'as in the past government must take a lead in promoting and protecting the rights of women', 'we also need to reflect as a nation whether we are making the necessary progress in advancing the constitutional rights of the disabled people', 'further part of our programme to bring about social equity is the successful implementation of the programme for black economic empowerment', 'clearly we need rigorous and visible progress in this area so as to ensure not only the distribution of wealth and economic power in line with the demographics of our country  but also to ensure that our economy and society as a whole can benefit from the wisdom and potential of all south africans and that the benefits of such empowerment are shared across society and not just by a few', 'government has accepted the most critical recommendations of the black economic empowerment commission', 'on the two specific areas of legislation and institutional frameworks it has been decided as follows  all sectoral legislation will be examined to ensure that the obligation of black economic empowerment is incorporated on the basis of common principles agreed upon', ' once a comprehensive policy statement on this issue has been finalised within the next four months a black economic empowerment council will be established bringing together government and other experts and practitioners in this critical area', ' government will as an actor in the economic arena particularly with regard to the massive procurement of goods and services reexamine its structures and systems to ensure that they fully meet the objective of black economic empowerment', 'i would like to emphasise that the task of black economic empowerment faces all sectors of society including the established business community', 'as is happening in the tourism industry progress will depend on active government leadership and cooperation from various sectors of the business community itself', 'i wish to thank cyril ramaphosa for his efforts in producing the report', 'a further challenge in ensuring inclusive economy pertains to access to microfinance', 'many enterprising south africans set out to establish small businesses but are unable to do so through the formal banking system nor to acquire the training that they need', 'khula and ntsika were established to spearhead this and they have been improving their work in the past few years', 'in order to ensure that the wisdom of the nation is tapped effectively and that ideas are processed into practical programmes as urgently as possible government will continue with intense consultations on microlending for the poor for purposes of income generation working with experts who by definition should include communities who have over the years run successful selfhelp financial schemes', 'combined with this initiative will be a comprehensive review of all institutions mandated to assist small medium and micro enterprises smmes', 'last year government announced a series of interventions by the state to help speed up the rate of investment and job creation', 'this we did having come to the conclusion that the country had achieved macroeconomic stability', 'we should at the very outset make bold to say that that conclusion stands', 'growth of our economy in  is expected to register more than  of gross domestic product a significant achievement given the global slowdown', 'interest rates though still high are lower than they have been for many years  and the same can be said about inflation', 'the budget deficit is much lower  and combined with revenue collection which is above the set targets this will afford us the possibility to expand expenditure in real terms especially on such important areas as social services and economic infrastructure', 'in other words barring the exchange rate all critical economic indicators have improved', 'the changing structure of our economy for the better is reflected among other things in the increase in manufactured exports and the fact that high rates of growth can be attained without undue pressure on the balance of payments', 'we are as a country within our right to be concerned about the volatility in the exchange rate and the kind of inexplicable movements that we experienced towards the end of last year', 'a variety of reasons have been given in this respect  and we all await the outcome of the inquiry headed by justice myburgh whom we wish to thank along with other commissioners and their staff for accepting the request to assist the nation in getting to the root of this problem', 'as government we are in no doubt that the sudden depreciation of the currency a few months ago is not a reflection of systemic or structural weaknesses in the economy as a whole', 'we will need to continue working with international financial institutions and developing countries to fashion a global financial architecture that cushions socalled emerging markets from occasional market irrationality', 'on the whole we should emphasise that the path of an open economy that we have charted for ourselves is not up for review', 'as we find our way into the future we shall not seek solace in the past', 'the programme that we announced last year to pay particular attention to a number of sectors of the economy will during the course of this year continue to unfold in the areas identified such as mining agriculture telecommunications tourism and manufacturing', 'many concrete steps have been taken to speed up work in these sectors and the relevant ministers will detail these in their briefings to parliament and the public', 'we shall here select a few areas for emphasis', 'to start off with a number of recent projects that have been brought to our attention convince us that the future holds much promise in terms of direct investment', 'mvelaphanda energy working with a consortium of two american companies has invested more than half a billion rand in the exploration of gas on the west coast', 'the consortium is exploring an area covering approximately  million acres within the orange river basin and has encountered excellent gas reserves that will supply a new form of energy to our country', 'mvelaphanda energy will soon be announcing a r billion investment in this project', 'furthermore a joint venture between a black empowerment company evertrade and a nasdaqlisted company will establish waste bin manufacturing facilities around the country for export with earnings estimated at about r billion in the next seven years', 'harmony gold has raised over r billion of foreign investments for the purchase of gold mines in the free state', 'to these we can add motor manufacturing companies which this year invested in excess of r billion an irish clothing and textile enterprise and many others', 'interaction with our business community has reinforced our confidence regarding their commitment to the growth of our economy and the prosperity of our society', 'in this regard we wish again to pay tribute to a south african patriot and leader the late marinus daling who departed from our midst a week ago', 'from the interactions we have had with government and business leaders in the european union japan china the us and other regions including at the recent world economic forum in new york it is quite clear that these trends will continue', 'critical in ensuring greater investment is the intensification of the work to build economic infrastructure and lower the cost of inputs', 'in this regard progress has been made in finalising ports policy and starting the process that will see to improvements in their efficiency', 'the nqurha industrial development zone has been designated and work on the port has started', 'despite the difficulties experienced during the course of the year progress has been made in the restructuring of the telecommunications sector transport energy and other areas of economic and social infrastructure with the primary aim of ensuring efficient and costeffective service', 'in this context the restructuring of state assets remains one of the primary areas of focus of the governments programme', 'one of the urgent tasks we have set ourselves is to finalise the setting up of a safety agency for our railways', 'in this context we wish to express our sympathies with the families of the bereaved and the injured in the recent train accident in kwadukuza kwazulunatal', 'we are highly appreciative of the agreement that has been reached in the transport sector and spoornet in particular to determine the kind of restructuring that enjoys the confidence of all the major stakeholders including the trade unions', 'steadily as these programmes reach their critical mass their impact on the lives of all south africans including in the area of sustainable jobcreation will start to be felt', 'the partnerships that we have referred to earlier contain within them possibilities for massive expansion of communitybased public works programmes', 'we also face the challenge of ensuring that the funds allocated to the national skills fund umsobomvu infrastructure and the employment subsidy are spent with the efficiency demanded by the actual needs of our society', 'experience over the past few months has raised the question of the impact of the rapid depreciation of our currency on the lives of ordinary south africans', 'it is a tribute to the changing structure of the economy that imported inflation has in recent years been kept to a minimum', 'we should also congratulate the agricultural sector for the work that they have done to finalise the strategic plan for south african agriculture which addresses all the complex issues of research equitable land distribution assistance to smallscale farmers and so on', 'government and the agricultural sector are working together urgently to move towards implementation of the plan', 'in a meeting of the joint working groups of government with big business black business agriculture and labour last december it was agreed to convene as early as possible a growth and development summit to address the urgent challenges facing us in the economy and build an enduring partnership in which all of us can lend a hand in building a prosperous south africa', 'a critical element of this engagement  at least a basic outline of which will have to be elaborated before such a summit  is a social accord or compact among all roleplayers', 'we need to ensure that each sector lends a hand for higher growth whose benefits can be shared equitably among all south africans', 'this will mean among other things achieving congruence in expectations and certainty in such matters as inflation wage and salary demands rates of investments positioning of the country in the global arena our role in nepad jobcreation and poverty alleviation', 'the approach to this critical initiative will be based among other things on the experiences already garnered in the millennium labour council and nedlac', 'achieving this compact is desirable if our economy is to develop to its full potential', 'nay more it is necessary if our society has to advance at the rate required by the social challenges we face', 'honourable members this spirit of service to society batho pele is what guides us as we pursue the restructuring of the public service', 'though slow progress is being made in negotiations with public sector unions as we try to forge a common understanding of the challenges of change which should benefit employer and employee the public servant and the public we are meant serve', 'and steadily through practical experience for example in urban renewal and rural development programmes in improving capacity in the presidency in the clusters of ministers and directorsgeneral and in the presidents coordinating council and other institutions integrated governance is becoming a reality', 'during the course of this year our country will celebrate the th anniversary of the adoption of our basic law', 'this is an occasion in which we pay tribute to those who led the negotiations process and the mass of our people who ultimately are the true midwives of our democracy', 'the interactions that we have had with various communities especially during imbizo activities demonstrate that the peoples wisdom in both policy development and implementation can only serve to enrich the quality of the services we render and make peoplecentred and peopledriven development a living reality', 'one of the injunctions of the constitution is that we must set up a commission on cultural religious and linguistic rights and we have already tabled legislation in parliament in this regard', 'in accordance with the governments comprehensive public service anticorruption strategy we have introduced measures to ensure that the code of conduct is upheld and that all public service managers are subject to conflict of interest disclosures', 'to complement this legislation to fight corruption will be brought before parliament during this session', 'among the matters that we will bring to successful conclusion this year is the definition of the role of traditional leaders in our system of government', 'the consultations that have taken place across the board have laid the basis for framework legislation', 'we will also this year finalise the restructuring of our national orders to reflect the art symbolism and idiom of south africa as a whole', 'work to build the freedom park monument will start this year so that south africans and the rest of humanity can celebrate this important shrine symbolising the rich heritage of our country in the evolution of the earth life and humanity and the struggle of part of that humanity for liberty', 'it is therefore appropriate that this monument is launched as we approach the end of the first decade of freedom in two years time', 'i would like to thank the freedom park board for having appointed the honourable wally serote to work as a fulltime chairperson on the freedom park monument so as to speedup the process', 'madame speaker chairperson what inspires us as we work with other leaders and peoples across the continent and further afield is to shape a new world defined by the needs of all humanity', 'we enter the year  with africa through its representative structures having formally embraced the commitment that this should in actual practice be the african century', 'various projects envisaged in nepad will start to unfold in parts of the continent as we turn the ideals in this document into practical action', 'during the course of last year our commitment to africas progress also found expression in the deployment of our sons and daughters in uniform in ethiopia the democratic republic of the congo and burundi', 'we did so because we remain confident that our sisterpeople in these countries will find solutions to their problems', 'we are humbled to play host to the intercongolese dialogue which commences this month in our country', 'in order to ensure that we stay true to our commitment to peace on the continent and other defence functions we shall continue with the programme to equip our national defence force in line with policies of the country adopted by its elected representatives', 'in pursuit of stability in our region we will work tirelessly to support the people of zimbabwe in their quest to hold free and fair elections in their country', 'it is in the interest of the people of zimbabwe and indeed the whole region that the government that emerges from the march elections is legitimate and enjoys the support of the majority', 'in order to play our part in ensuring that this happens and in response to the wishes of zimbabweans themselves we will within a week send a multisectoral south african observer mission to zimbabwe led by dr sam motsuenyane', 'i am informed that parliament is also ready to send a parliamentary observer team on the same issue', 'clearly the mission and the conditions that our teams seek to create are one and only one let the people of zimbabwe speak through the ballot box  further we wish to express our solidarity with our brothers and sisters in lesotho who are due to hold their national elections in may this year after a long process of negotiations among themselves', 'this year we will continue with efforts to attain peace and development in the democratic republic of the congo angola and the comoros', 'we shall also persist with whatever we can contribute to ensure that the destruction of the palestinian authority is brought to an end and that peace and security for the palestinian and israeli children become a reality', 'again we shall during the course of the year continue to strengthen economic and other forms of cooperation with countries of the european union japan and the rest of asia china the usa and the americas in pursuit of africas development our own national interests and the interests of humanity as a whole', 'in this regard we shall continue to challenge a pessimism that expects africa to fail in any of its endeavours and the undeclared doctrine of collective punishment against all africans that seems to come into effect when one or some among our leaders stumble', 'we wish once more to reiterate our solidarity with the people of the united states for the terrible events of  september ', 'if anything our fervent hope is that this tragedy will continue to reawaken in all of us our bonds as a global human family', 'along with other countries under the aegis of the united nations south africa will make whatever modest contribution it can in the reconstruction of afghanistan', 'madame speaker chairperson the ingredients for faster progress on all fronts of our work are there', 'the primary one among these is our collective appreciation that no one and no one can do for us what we should do for ourselves', 'in this programme we lay out the main challenges that face us in the coming year and beyond', 'what guides our approach is that each one of us should lend a hand in doing the simple things that will make a difference to the lives of especially the poor', 'together as a people we have made great strides', 'the successes we have achieved make the clear statement that acting together we can and shall continue to push back the frontiers of poverty and expand access to a better life', 'thank you very much']"

national council of provinces  honorable members of parliament  distinguished guests  ladies and gentlemen  a new year is upon us once more affording us the opportunity to account in a comprehensive manner to the citizens on the awesome responsibilities they have mandated us to fulfill', 'all of us in the executive and legislatures the majority party and members in the opposition benches are called upon to outline practical programmes to improve the nations quality of life', 'again and again over the past year the people showed remarkable commitment to the countrys wellbeing', 'they took advantage of resources offered through rdp projects', 'they turned adversity into opportunity in the export market', 'they excelled in international sporting events including the olympics and paralympics', 'and they joined hands to raise awareness around crime and actually to work together to combat it', 'in practical action a new nation is being forged  a nation whose new patriotism and sense of pride derive not only from ideas in our hearts but also from concrete progress made in improving the wellbeing of all', 'our task is to mobilize all our people to create more and more opportunities to ensure that the citizens potential is given the fullest expression', 'we have to do this and more sensitive to the feelings of the majority and the minority the haves and the havenots those who have the media to communicate their ideas and those deprived of such resources', 'we can all derive pride from the fact that we took a historic step in this direction last year through the adoption of the new constitution the basic law of our land reflecting the nations yearning for a rising quality of life in circumstances of democracy peace and respect for human rights', 'in a sense this is the first session of the new parliament', 'and allow me to take this opportunity to welcome members of the national council of provinces the living embodiment of cooperative governance', 'their presence here already starts to redefine relations between government and the people not abstract national or regional or local people but south africans requiring and deserving of the highest professional service from their elected representatives', 'last friday i had the honour to thank our erstwhile senators for their service to the nation', 'i wish to reiterate that today', 'at the same time as they infused the debate in these chambers with their unique knowledge and expertise they were also pioneers at an important moment of creation the culmination of which is national parliament as we have it today', 'the major restructuring of parliament represented by these changes epitomizes the maturing of our democracy', 'of no less significance is the process that led to the adoption of the constitution including mass involvement on the one hand and the meticulous approach of the constitutional court on the other', 'with each major judgment this court grows in stature and places our democracy on a higher pedestal', 'cooperative governance and the new patriotism also mean a loyal opposition an opposition that opposes but remains loyal to the constitution  an opposition that takes part in the major national programmes to reconstruct to develop to reconcile to improve south africas standing in the world to enhance business confidence to put shoulders to the wheel in the fight against crime in brief an opposition that takes full part in the efforts to build a better life for all', 'we are encouraged that all parties in this chamber have committed themselves to this national consensus', 'through the new constitution we have laid the foundation for a peaceful and prosperous nation', 'but it is just that a foundation', 'and it will not amount to much if its provisions are not felt in the daily life of our people', 'we must and will popularise the constitution', 'but above all we need to act together to implement its provisions', 'we can take pride madame speaker in the fact that as we enter the last half of this governments mandate in ail matters of governance we have laid the foundation to move even more speedily to our nations goals', 'we enter  with all but one locality in the whole country enjoying democratic local governance', 'the completion of this process during the course of last year was significant not only in the peaceful manner in which it was conducted but also because a new corps of leaders has emerged in close touch with the people and steadily but surely starting to make an impact on their lives', 'to improve the food security and nutrition of at least the most indigent of the population projects which amount to rmillion and reaching over a million people were undertaken last year', 'the primary school nutrition programme now benefits more than million children', 'programmes to develop new farming entrepreneurs to return land to communities and resettle others and to start tenure reform are starting to change the face of our countryside', 'over   people have already been supplied with water and projects are under way which will affect over million citizens', 'after two years of preparing the ground the national housing policy is now fully operational', 'today more houses are in production than at any other time in south africas history', 'millions now enjoy the benefits of electricity', 'arguably nowhere else is the fact of democratic transformation felt more keenly than in the area of universal access to health facilities', 'the building of clinics and hospitals the immunisation programme and the beginnings of a new drugs policy  all these and more are practical and new qualitative steps that have transformed the majority of south africans from being neglected outcasts into beneficiaries of a compassionate health policy', 'during the course of last year by dint of hard work by the health ministry the efforts of relevant communitybased organisations and ironically the debates around one famous play the campaign against aids was more visibly put on the national agenda', 'indeed it is in part because of south africas efforts that we were invited to take part in the unaids meeting in davos switzeriand just this week', 'for the first time in south africas history citizens are starting to benefit from integrated human resource development represented by a nonracial education system life skills training financial support to students in tertiary institutions supply side measures in industry to promote training and a sports programme based not only on the promotion of healthy lifestyles but also on constructing facilities in areas that were hitherto neglected', 'madame speaker   with the estimated  growth during the course of last year the south african economy has turned the comer towards consistent expansion', 'beneath this figure which is of course less than what all of us would prefer are strong signals of a robust industrial revolution in the making', 'this is reflected in the many megaprojects with investments of more than halfabillion rand each a phenomenal growth in fixed investments and improved capacity utilisation in enterprises', 'the physical volume of production is on a steep rise and so are our manufactured exports', 'the potential of the tourism industry has started to manifest itself  and in the overall our balance of payments has started to improve', 'we are heartened by the fact that small and medium enterprises can today boast of a government that not only promotes their interests  but one that has in place the structures the procurement policies and the will to allocate resources to this sector', 'be it in the housing programme the building of roads the school nutrition programme and public works projects these entrepreneurs are gradually becoming a critical part of the economic mainstream', 'we are confident that the new labour relations legislation so painstakingly set in motion during the course of last year will improve the management of this important area', 'although no one piece of legislation can be a panacea to our deep social problems this new regime should temper conflicts at the workplace and help strengthen the partnership between business and labour in national development', 'despite exchange rate pressures our fiscal and monetary authorities have performed extremely well to ensure that we meet the targeted budget deficit and improve the management of government finances', 'in brief great progress is being made to implement the growth employment and redistribution strategy itself an achievement in integrated planning introduced last year', 'another such achievement which is starting to make a difference is the national crime prevention strategy', 'despite the difficulties despite the fact that such achievements mean little to those who still experience crime the fact of the matter is that the offensive is on particularly with regard to most priority crimes', 'government is confident of making further progress in the fight for safety security and stability', 'in this regard the role of the intelligence services deserves special mention', 'these brave policemen and women and intelligence operatives have made a critical contribution behind the scenes to the success that we have started to register', 'we pay tribute to all these dedicated citizens who quite often put their own lives in danger so that we can all lead safe and secure lives', 'indeed madame speaker we have laid the foundation for a better life', 'this is what the reconstruction and development programme is about', 'the rdp is alive and well', 'it is not merely a sum of projects but an integrated national programme to improve the nations quality of life', 'but we would be less than candid if we did not acknowledge our shortcomings', 'firstly because of capacity constraints some projects could not be undertaken', 'for instance a number of provinces have barely spent the funds allocated to them for housing and building of classrooms', 'it therefore does not make much sense to our people for us to decry the debt burden and lack of resources while we are unable to utilise even what we have', 'secondly ordinary citizens continue to complain about practices that have not changed in many government offices', 'corruption including the endemic problem of socalled ghost workers inherited from the past continues to bedevil the civil service', 'thirdly the growth achieved last year was not sufficient to absorb entrants into the labour market', 'lastly there are increased reports of crimes such as child abuse rape and domestic violence', 'in some instances offenders easily elude our criminal justice system because of a fragmented and ridiculously backward data base', 'we can list other examples not to create despair  but because we are determined to address these shortcomings', 'this will be a major area of focus in our programme this year', 'the primary consideration in this programme is the citizen', 'for we can peddle figures of billions allocated to any project  but the question is whether the funds have been spent and how they have benefited the citizen the people come first  and our models strategies and plans should be measured by this yardstick', 'in a nutshell the weaknesses we have identified boil down to three things cooperative governance management and capacitybuilding', 'in so far as local government is concerned there is nothing as urgent and as critical as the training of councillors', 'their ability to raise funds and manage them to play their role in the multibillion housing and infrastructure programmes to attract investments to deal with distortions of the apartheid era and to work with communities in a partnership for development are skills that should be built more intensively this year', 'at the same time amendments will be introduced to the local government transition act to help stabilise local government finances', 'while provincial and national government will step in to assist where practicable progress in this regard will depend on the masakhane effort to build cooperation between communities and their local representatives', 'closely related to the issue of local government is the matter of traditional leaders', 'in a number of areas the social fabric of communities has suffered because of conflict between elected structures and traditional authorities', 'we will this year intensify interaction with this institution and we hope to launch the national council of traditional leaders within three months', 'this year in keeping with the spirit of the new constitution some of the recommendations of the finance and fiscal commission and consultation between national and provincial structures a large percentage of the national budget will be allocated globally to the provinces', 'this step implies greater responsibility and accountability on the part of the provinces', 'intense discussions are taking place between national and provincial executive structures', 'in these consultations the vexed questions of national minimum standards national priorities national norms in spending and a rigorous common system of finance management are being thrashed out  and we are confident that there will be no major hiccups', 'in the final analysis the question is not so much technically what powers and rights this or the other sphere of government has  but what service we can perform and how well we should cooperate in meeting the mandate of building a better life for all', 'closely tied to this is the question whether we are making any headway in transforming the civil service to become a public service in fact', 'i wish to congratulate the staff at all levels for their efforts during the trying times of transition', 'we had to land running', 'and because significant achievements were made in social delivery an impression was created that we had found in place a civil service ready to implement the new policies', 'from the experience of the presidential review commission it is quite clear to us that while work on longterm restructuring of the public service should continue immediate practical actions are required to speed up the transformation', 'from the investigations that the national ministry is conducting in the provinces task teams will be sent to deal with such weaknesses as personnel records management of finance strategic planning and prioritisation information technology and labour relations', 'what may seem simple and straightforward are precisely the things that require thorough attention', 'without this the danger is as stark as it is real that we shall not be able to meet the challenges of transforming society', 'the green paper on service delivery has been drafted and the aim is to have legislation in place as soon as is practicable', 'at the same time it has become critical to examine the question of government services which can easily more costeffectively and more efficiently be undertaken outside of government', 'this has to be done with sensitivity with the interests of the citizen at the centre of our considerations', 'i wish to assure the civil service that all these changes will take place on the basis of consultation', 'the historic agreement reached last year on a new salary and grading system is still in place', 'like with all agreements there were conditions applying to both sides and government will strive to honour both the spirit and the letter of the agreement', 'if and when a review is required this will be pursued on the basis of negotiations', 'indeed if we do not restructure the service it will be difficult if not impossible to build on the foundation that has been laid', 'we shall have good plans and even the resources to carry them out', 'but we shall yearin and yearout be saddled with unspent funds terrible services and millions siphoned off in corrupt practices in callous disregard of the most vulnerable sections of society', 'madame speaker   the challenges in the areas of safety and security derive also from similar weaknesses', 'we need to ensure that when a crime has been prioritised that emphasis is felt throughout the whole criminal justice system', 'we should this year establish a comprehensive data base improve the witness protection programme empower victims and introduce a new style of work with clear delivery targets and deadlines which must be met', 'we are also putting in place proper mechanisms of coordination among the police the intelligence community and the prosecutors particularly on crimes that are a national priority', 'further within the framework of our commitment to the culture of human rights government is grappling with the issue of bail and appropriate sentences for such serious offences as rape and murder associated with robbery', 'legislation on these issues is being drafted', 'this is being done along with practical measures to improve the investigative capacity of the police', 'let me warn the criminals especially the car hijackers the drug syndicates those who smuggle weapons corrupt personnel in the criminal justice system the rapists and child abusers and those involved in taxi violence we will continue to escalate the offensive against them  we will make their life really difficult this year', 'many of them have been identified and we have examined the ways in which they have been evading the law', 'we are closing in on them  and we shall demonstrate convincingly that in our young democracy crime does not pay  in the near future we shall complete the investigation and take steps to cut the number of commercial entry points into the country including some odd socalled international airports', 'it is quite clear that the careless attitude of the days of third force destabilisation and sanctionsbusting is not only providing a heaven for criminals some of whom were part of these networks  but it is also plainly and simply a threat to national security', 'however when ail is said and done success depends on our whole society adopting a new value system', 'for in many ways by buying stolen goods conniving with unscrupulous businesspersons to evade tax allowing criminals to lord it over communities we do become our own worst enemies', 'we also become our own worst enemies by cooperating with forces which commit crimes such as murder and destruction of property in the name of campaigning against gangs and drugs', 'we must mobilise against crime yes  but as partners in a lawgoverned society that respects our legitimate government and other citizens  a lawgoverned society that does not tolerate illegal occupation of land and houses', 'as a result of the tireless efforts of the police the intelligence community the national defence force as well as the affected communities and political religious and business leaders we have all but eliminated political violence', 'for this all these sectors and others must be commended', 'yet with the kind of timing selection of victims and political rationalisation that are bizarre in the strictest sense of the word some individuals decided a few weeks ago to use bombs to challenge our democracy', 'we have examined these dark clouds and we are certain that the storm they threatened to bring has been averted', 'let me reiterate that there is no reason at all for any of our citizens to seek redress through violence', 'the avenues are there in the constitution and the structures it sets out for airing grievances', 'it will be the height of folly for anyone to seek to provoke the patience of a people who have elected against their own deep emotions to forgive and to reconcile', 'for their retribution will be decisive and telling', 'honourable members   let me take this opportunity to commend the truth and reconciliation commission for the magnificent work they are doing to realise their mandate', 'we did not expect their work to be easy', 'and we are struck by the impact they are making on the national psyche for theirs is a process that hurts as much as it cleanses', 'we are confident that they will be able to meet their deadline  and we hope that the recent decision they and the freedom front persuaded us to take on the amnesty deadline will assist in their work', 'in this regard and in the interest of an inclusive process i take this opportunity to place before parliament the recommendation that the cutoff date for amnesty be extended to  may ', 'as it inches towards the truth the trc is helping to seal the coffin of a heinous system and to unearth what remnants of the old networks that may still be burrowing in our midst', 'it is helping to consolidate our democracy  and thus to complement the magnificent work of the public protector the human rights commission and other such institutions', 'another set of institutions critical to the advancement of our society are the youth and gender commissions', 'we are confident that the youth commission will this year start to make its presence felt throughout society promoting the interests of this precious asset to our nation', 'after considering recommendations from parliament i have accepted the names put forward for the gender commission', 'i wish to congratulate the chairperson thenjiwe mthintso and the other commissionersdesignate whose names will be made known in a media statement during the course of the day', 'let me also take this opportunity also to welcome the new chief justice of the land ismail mahomed  and to assure him and the judiciary that we shall promote their independence and do our bit to make their work easier', 'madame speaker   we have earlier noted the progress in the implementation of our socioeconomic programmes', 'during the course of this year we shall further speed up the process of practical implementation', 'south africa must become a beehive of communities acting to change their lives for the better', 'the nutrition programmes we referred to earlier should reach oneandahalf million people and a further  million schoolchildren', 'close on to twohundred thousand housing units are in line for construction', ' agricultural ventures should be completed this year to develop new farming entrepreneurs', 'a further  million people will benefit from the water and sanitation programme  and over twohundred thousand destitute people in rural areas should be allocated land on which they can live normal lives', 'more public works programmes will be undertaken especially the rural areas and the bill on secure tenure rights should be adopted this year', 'i wish to reassure the commercial farming sector that these measures as well as the proposals on water rights will be pursued in a manner that does not undermine an industry which is so critical to the nations food security and exports', 'at the same time we all know too well that longterm security and productivity in the countryside depend primarily on the upliftment of poor rural communities', 'this year more than  clinics will be built or upgraded and the construction of at least  hospitals should commence', 'we aim in this period to decrease the national backlog in devices for the disabled by   and we will strive to achieve an  cure rate for tuberculosis by ', 'in line with the south african schools act we will start implementing provisions relating to compulsory attendance a code of conduct for teachers and students and national norms for funding', 'a white paper on higher education should have been introduced by the end of the year  and we hope to reach the same number of students with the financial aid scheme as this past year', 'it should be emphasised that the basic criterion to determine continued assistance will be academic performance', 'the restructuring of the welfare system has begun', 'we will ensure speedy implementation of the decision to attain efficiency resolve the problem of corruption and bring more focus on those in acute need especially unemployed mothers with children under five', 'these are just examples of some of the programmes we are committing ourselves to', 'within the departments responsible for these programmes the process of reorienting spending and costing plans on a mediumterm basis will continue', 'related to this is a delicate balance that needs to be struck between two extremes on the one hand our tender procedures are either not suitable to current needs or they are at times so rigidly applied as to become a break on implementation', 'on the other hand there are instances where individuals in authority have ridden roughshod over these procedures leading to unauthorised expenditure', 'these procedures need to be reviewed in line with the demands of transformation', 'the confidence we have regarding these socioeconomic commitments derives from the fact that our economic fundamentals are sound', 'this has given us a firm base from which to achieve higher and sustainable rates of growth and development', 'the governments programme to facilitate this positive trend is guided by the critical signposts identified in our macroeconomic strategy namely growth in production for export infrastructural development restructuring of state assets reduction of the budget deficit human resource development and a comprehensive labour relations dispensation', 'critical in all this is to create jobs and ensure equitable redistribution of wealth', 'our programme this year includes the implementation of the maputo development corridor initiative in terms of road construction and the other industries big and small', 'similar initiatives will be launched in kwazulunatal and the eastern cape', 'investigations are being conducted in the northern and northwestern provinces  and in all these projects great care will be exercised to allocate a given percentage to small contractors', 'in cape town johannesburg and pretoria metropolitan development initiatives will be launched combining industrial hubs housing and community centres roads and other infrastructure', 'through these initiatives we shall start to fundamentally reverse apartheid planning ensure that workers stay close to their workplaces and that the racial divide in residential areas is done away with', 'the municipal infrastructure programme will see to the implementation of over a thousand projects costing more than a billion rand  and the gigantic programmes in the telecommunications industry will start to change the lives of millions', 'in order to encourage changes in production methods and improve skills training and technology usage a number of incentives will be put in place during the course of the year', 'and the tax holiday initiative has become fully operational', 'a range of promotional measures and diplomatic initiatives will be undertaken to facilitate exports', 'at the same time significant progress is being made to tap foreign capital as the true potential of the country becomes more and more apparent abroad', 'all these elements of our industrial revolution will go a long way to create jobs and we should start slowly but surely to reduce the army of the unemployed', 'the macroeconomic strategy identifies the restructuring of state assets as a critical part of our programme to attract investments and technology ensure efficiency guarantee affordable prices and reorient state assets towards the goals of reconstruction and development', 'in a matter of months besides the mammoth task of general restructuring telkom will acquire a strategic equity partner and sunair and aventura will be wholly privatised', 'the airports company and safcol in forestry should complete their bidding processes this year', 'alexkor in diamond mining is also being attended to', 'south african airways and autonet should have completed their restructuring processes by the first half of  and intense discussions are under way in transnet to address these and other subsidiaries', 'all these steps will be taken in full consultation with all roleplayers  and i wish to urge both management and workers to respect this principle', 'our nation should be proud of a trade union movement that has taken active part in the major national debates and along with business started to realise cooperative relations in the workplace and in nedlac', 'but yet on both counts the trade union movement faces the challenge of unity across racial lines taking advantage of the opportunities that have opened up and adapting fully to the challenges of the current phase', 'on the other hand business has a long way to go with regard to such issues as equity in the workplace and reorienting companies to the developmental needs of the moment', 'we hope that this year negotiations on issues of basic conditions of employments employment equity and the vexed question of a national social agreement will reach some resolution', 'as indicated earlier we are equally optimistic with regard to issue of government expenditure', 'during the course of this year we shall complete the plans towards mediumterm budgeting in order to bring budget allocations closer to our strategic objectives and to speed up reprioritisation within departments', 'we shall also intensify efforts to improve the governments management of cash flows and eliminate unnecessary burdens on the fiscus', 'i also wish to emphasise that in our efforts as government to ensure that the nation lives within its means we will take into account our mandate to the electorate particularly the social requirements of the present and the future and the benefits that will accrue from bold decisions', 'the south african revenue service should be commended for the improvements in the tax collection system', 'we are however concerned that many people are not meeting their tax obligations and as such the tax burden is borne by too few honest citizens', 'it is fair to assume that we all want the programmes outlined above to materialise  that we all want south africa to succeed', 'but we must be prepared to foot the bill for success', 'to broaden the tax base and break the culture of nonpayment we have offered certain relief measures which expire on  february this year', 'all persons who qualify are again urged to make us of this opportunity', 'those who have not responded should be assured that after this will be the knock of the taxman and woman backed by the full force of the law', 'in the overall we are confident that we have moved into high gear in the implementation of the macroeconomic strategy', 'i would also like to reaffirm our commitment to the phased removal of remaining exchange controls', 'we appreciate the new surge among all sectors to promote south africas true qualities abroad', 'this has already helped improve the economic environment and with the cooperation of all it can only get better', 'i wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the south african national defence force for its continuing contribution to the maintenance of our countrys integrity for the assistance it has rendered to the police in combating crime and dealing with natural disasters and for the speed with which it has taken up the challenge to prepare for active peacekeeping tasks that we may be called upon to undertake', 'the integration process and development of new doctrines have proceeded fairly well', 'but we cannot claim that the process has been flawless', 'the challenge is for the former statutory forces to embrace change and to eschew the temptation to maintain the status quo', 'it is for the former nonstatutory forces to utilise the positions they hold to help speed up transformation and not shy away from responsibilities at the slightest hint of difficulties', 'debate will continue this year on the white paper and the defence review but what is critical is to move towards practical implementation', 'one of the issues in this regard is the defence forces requirements for equipment', 'the question here is not whether but how to meet these requirements and how much the country can afford', 'as commanderlnchief i wish to emphasise that we shall not shirk our responsibility to the defence force', 'we are confident that out of all these efforts we shall strengthen our unity as a nation', 'but this will also depend on the ability of government to communicate clearly coherently and professionally as well as the preparedness of the media to transmit and interpret our actions and omissions in a professional objective and fair manner', 'the government welcomes the report of the communications task group and its recommendations are being processed for implementation', 'as we improve south africas communications including in the areas of culture film monuments and other media  as we mature to understand one another better and as we join hands to improve our quality of life we shall at the same time be building a nation ready for the challenges of the next millennium', 'madame speaker   our young democracy is still grappling with the challenge of its positioning in the international milieu', 'it is understandable that at times this debate will be heated and acrimonious  because it is a debate more than just about how we relate to the world', 'it is part of the process of defining who we are', 'it is part of the resolution of past divisions within south african society  divisions which informed our divergent views of the world', 'within the southern african development community the first steps have been taken towards a free trade area within  years', 'historic initiatives exemplified by the maputo development corridor are gradually going to become the norm as we bring our collective strength to bear to meet common challenges', 'it is a measure of our collective destiny that even bilateral negotiations between ourselves and the european community had to be underpinned by regional realities', 'welcome progress was made in bilateral trade arrangements with zimbabwe and we aim to move faster this year to complete negotiations on the customs union', 'we were honoured last year to be elected as chairperson of the sadc for three years  and we will continue to work to strengthen the community and enhance its standing in africa and abroad', 'in this context we shall continue to make our humble contribution to the resolution of the crisis in the great lakes region and to assist in facilitating the peace process in angola', 'over the past year we strengthened our relations with countries such as india and others in asia brazil and others in latin america saudi arabia and others in the middle east', 'we are all only starting to appreciate the full meaning of these relations in terms of exports opportunities for investments and sources of capital', 'and evolving quietly from this is a special relationship that is more or less natural among countries with broadly the same level of development socioeconomic challenges and interests', 'how this will impact on southsouth cooperation assist in redefining the world balance of forces and enhance the unique potential of each of the countries are matters that still require further examination', 'our commitment to the strengthening of the organisation of african unity is a matter of course', 'we also wish to congratulate un secretarygeneral kofi annan and offer our cooperation as this august body restructures itself', 'as president of the united nations conference on trade and development we will continue to contribute to building the bridges of cooperation between the north and the south', 'we shall also start in earnest this year to prepare for the next summit of the nonaligned movement which we shall be honoured to host in ', 'in the next few days we shall play host to the king of

'binational commissions with the us russia and the federal republic of germany and our special relations with countries of northern and western europe japan and others speak of the positive climate that we have to pursue south africas interests which are in many respects the interests of the majority of the worlds peoples', 'we shall not falter in our contribution to the resolution of conflict and promotion of peace throughout the world', 'in this context and in the context of our own principles we shall continue to approach the issue of the manufacture and sale of weapons with circumspection', 'and as in everything else we do we shall always defend our right as a nation independently to take decisions', 'honourable members   in all areas of endeavour we have laid the foundation for success', 'at work in sport and leisure in business and the professions in the schools and places of worship we are forging a resilient nation  a nation conscious of its responsibilities to itself to future generations and to the world in which we live', 'the government has got the practical programmes in place to contribute decisively to the attainment of the nations objectives', 'at the same time as we intensify the implementation of reconstruction and development we shall improve cooperative governance as well as capacity and management at all levels', 'the foundation for a better life has been laid', 'in the spirit of the new patriotism we can only rise to new heights']"

improve its composition', 'we are engaged with labour and other stakeholders on measures to contain the public wage bill and reduce wastage', 'efforts to reduce government spending prioritise resources more effectively and improve the efficiency of our tax system are important  but insufficient  contributions towards stabilising our public finances', 'achieving sustainability will ultimately require us to address structural challenges in the economy that raise the cost of living and doing business', 'by working with the auditorgeneral to reduce irregular expenditure by shifting government spending from consumption expenditure to investment in infrastructure we aim to improve the state of public finances', 'the national treasury and the sarb are working together to ease

of our nation to wish all the honourable members of parliament a happy and productive new year', 'i am confident that  will be one of the most remarkable years of our democracy as we all work together to realise the core aspiration of our people to attain a better life for all', 'i say this because in our own estimation it is not often that a nation is called upon to strain every sinew of its collective body to attain a dream', 'and such is the injunction that history has imposed on us today', 'i speak here today in the presence of my mother epainette mbeki mamofokeng who came to communicate an unequivocal message from the rural masses of the transkei among whom she has lived for many decades', 'she says these masses demand of all of us who claim to be their leaders that we tell them and others like them elsewhere in our country whether we remain committed to the undertaking we have made that tomorrow will be better than today', 'in eight days time on february  she will be  years old', 'what she expects as her birthday present is the truth', 'i thank her for taking the trouble to be with us today and trust that we will not disappoint her', 'i would also like to take this opportunity to salute president nelson mandela one of the preeminent founding fathers of our democracy who will mark his th birthday on  july this year', 'we welcome to this occasion mr arthur

was murdered by apartheid agents  years ago', 'we are also pleased that we have among us mr dinilesizwe sobukwe son of the outstanding patriot and leader robert sobukwe who also passed away  years back after enduring many years of imprisonment banishment and other forms of repression', 'we acknowledge both among the honourable members and our guests the many founders of the united democratic front  years ago', 'all these honoured guests representing both memory and hope remind us by their presence that ours is a task in a relay race of continuous rebirth so that the dream of a better life becomes a reality for all south africans', 'indeed they represent a celebration of the indomitable spirit of our people and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not betray or disappoint the expectations of the people', 'we are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third democratic parliament and government soon after which we will hold our fourth general elections', 'the government has therefore reviewed the distance we have travelled in terms of implementing the mandate given by the people in ', 'i am pleased to say that we have indeed done much to implement the commitments we made to the people in ', 'however and not unexpectedly it is obvious that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard', 'given that we are approaching the end of our mandate term the government decided that it should identify a suite of apex priorities on which it must focus in a special way using these as catalysts further to accelerate progress towards the achievement of the objectives the people mandated us to pursue', 'happily this state of the nation address has given me the possibility to report to parliament and the nation on our  apex priorities which the hon members can find on the government website during the course of next week', 'the identification of the apex priorities means that all three spheres of government the national provincial and local at both executive and administrative levels are hereby making the firm undertaking that we will use the short period ahead of us further to energise our advance towards the realisation of the allimportant goal of a better life for all our people', 'the entirety of our system of governance is therefore making the commitment that in the period ahead of us it will do its best to live up to the imperative  business unusual we speak of business unusual not referring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the speedy efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes so that the lives of our people should change for the better sooner rather than later', 'to make certain that this happens we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the annual budget the minister of finance will present later this month makes the necessary allocations to give us the means to implement the apex priorities', 'the main categories of these priorities are   the further acceleration of our economic growth and development   speeding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social goals   improving the effectiveness of our interventions directed at the second economy and poverty eradication   enhancing the impact of our programmes targeting the critically important area of education and training   accelerating our advance towards the achievement of the goal of health for all   revamping the criminal justice system to intensify our offensive against crime   further strengthening the machinery of government to ensure that it has the capacity to respond to our development imperatives and   enhancing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations with particular focus on some african issues and southsouth relations', 'more than at any other time the situation that confronts our nation and country and the tasks we have set ourselves demand that we inspire and organise all our people to act together as one to do all the things that have to be done understanding that in a very real sense all of us together hold our own future in our hands  as we act together everywhere in our country this we must also understand that what we have to be about is  business unusual  as i was preparing this address one among us suggested to me that our country was being buffeted by strong crosswinds that made it especially difficult to foresee where our country will be tomorrow', 'he suggested that this morning to capture what he considers the essence of the reality confronting us i should recall the wellknown words with which charles dickens opened his novel a tale of two cities', 'and so i quote these words  it was the best of times it was the worst of times it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness it was the epoch of belief it was the epoch of incredulity it was the season of light it was the season of darkness it was the spring of hope it was the winter of despair we had everything before us we had nothing before us we were all going direct to heaven we were all going direct the other way  in short the period was so far like the present period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received for good or for evil in the superlative degree of comparison only', '  you will ask whether i agree with this assessment whether i too believe that we have entered an era of confusion in which all of us cannot but lose our way unsure of our steps unsteady on our feet fearful of the future  my answer to this question is a definite no like the rest of our government i am convinced that the fundamentals that have informed our countrys forward march in the last  years remain in place', 'they continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proceed as we keep our eyes firmly focused on the continued pursuit of the goal of a better life for all our people', 'thus should we all reaffirm that we remain on course as we continue to strive to make ours a winning nation', 'however like all the honourable members i am aware of the fact that many in our society are troubled by a deep sense of unease about where our country will be tomorrow', 'they are concerned about the national emergency into which the country has been thrown by the unexpected disruptions in the supply of electricity', 'they are concerned about some developments in our economy especially the steady increase in interest rates food and fuel prices which further impoverish especially the poor', 'some among these worry about the possible impact on our own economy of the threat of economic recession in the united states', 'they are worried about whether we have the capacity to defend the democratic rights and the democratic constitution which were born of enormous sacrifices', 'this is driven by such developments as the prosecution of the national commissioner of police the suspension of the national director of public prosecutions fears about a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law and the attendant allegations about the abuse of state power for political purposes', 'they are worried about whether our country is threatened by the anarchy represented by the criminal torching of six passenger trains in tshwane last month', 'while they recognise and respect the right of the ruling party to regulate its own affairs they are concerned that it must continue to play its role as one of the principal architects of a democratic nonracial nonsexist and prosperous south africa', 'most obviously it would be irresponsible to ignore these and other concerns or dismiss them as mere jeremiads typical of the prophets of doom', 'the real challenge is to respond to them in a manner that conveys the definite message to everybody in our country and the millions in africa and elsewhere in the world who watch our country with keen interest that we remain firm in our resolve to continue building the kind of south africa that has given hope not only to our people but also to many others outside our borders', 'let me therefore make bold to say that this historical moment demands that our nation should unite as never before and strain every sinew of its collective body to address our common challenges and keep alive the dream that has sustained all of us as we travelled along the uncharted road towards the creation of the south africa visualised in our constitution', 'the national emergency represented by the current power outages poses the challenge and presents the opportunity to the entirety of our nation to give concrete expression to the call we have just made for all of us to unite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course', 'this must say to all of us that we are indeed in a period of challenges but surmountable challenges', 'and precisely because it is a period of challenges it is also an era of opportunity  in this regard i would like to express our appreciation and full agreement with the comments made by the chief executive of anglo american cynthia carroll when she addressed the mining indaba here in cape town earlier this week on tuesday february ', 'as the honourable members know she said i dont regard the problems of energy supply here as a disaster', 'and south africa is not alone there are pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in chile and brazil', 'sure the problems here are serious  overcoming them will require ingenuity especially in energy efficiency and energy saving as well as the development of alternative power supplies', 'but if all of us can forge strong partnerships to tackle the situation we will all come through  i hope relatively unscathedthis is not a time for finger pointing but for working together in finding solutions', '  this having been said it is however also necessary that we take this opportunity to convey to the country the apologies of both the government and eskom for the national emergency which has resulted in all of us having to contend with the consequences of load shedding', 'i would also like to thank all citizens for their resilience and forbearing in the face of the current difficulties', 'in the past two weeks the ministers of minerals and energy and public enterprises have outlined the nature of the emergency we confront and what each one of us can do to normalise the situation', 'last week the honourable members had an opportunity to reflect on these matters', 'in essence the significant rise in electricity demand over the last two years has outstripped the new capacity we have brought on stream', 'the resultant tight supply situation makes the overall system vulnerable to any incident affecting the availability of energy', 'in this situation we have to curtail the unplanned outages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce demand and thus ensure a better reserve margin', 'as government our task is to now lead and unite the country behind a campaign for energy efficiency that will address this challenge', 'among other things we must use the current adversity to ensure that our homes and economy become more energy efficient', 'there are concrete actions each individual household and business can take', 'these are being disseminated by the department of minerals and energy and we remain open to any other suggestions that you our compatriots may give to us and share with one another', 'government will start implementing a campaign to ensure efficient lighting solar water heating and geyser load management in households including housing standards for all new houses and developments', 'we urge households that can afford to act immediately to consider implementing these energysaving measures', 'an instruction has been issued for all government buildings to reduce their consumption of electricity and please feel free to name and shame those who do not', 'the details of other voluntary and mandatory actions in the power conservation programme have been set out by the ministers and these will be refined through consultation with the various stakeholders and then published', 'on the supply side eskom is working furiously to ensure the introduction of cogeneration projects as a matter of urgency', 'we are taking steps to enhance eskoms maintenance capacity', 'we have emergency task teams dealing with the challenge of coal quality and supply with the coal mining industry and we are working to fast track the approval and construction of gas turbine projects', 'all these actions taken together with the electricity saving measures will improve certainty and raise the reserve margin', 'the massive eskom build programme in new generation transmission and distribution capacity will continue  and where possible some projects will be accelerated', 'in this regard i would like to thank the private sector for being prepared to assist in whatever way they can', 'in a meeting with the chairman of general electric ge during the course of last week ge offered to assist by procuring scarce turbine equipment on our behalf', 'in south africa our own large companies such as sasol anglo and bhp billiton are all in concrete discussions with the departments of mineral and energy and public enterprises to find cost effective and sustainable solutions to the supply constraint', 'the approach is one of common action rather than recrimination', 'i particularly want to pay tribute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assisted us and the economy to resolve a real crisis that hit us on the th of january', 'we will all work to minimise the adverse impact these events had on the industry', 'collective effort and consultation are at the centre of our response to the emergency', 'task teams are currently working in many areas', 'next week the provincial premiers will convene their fora with mayors to plan and implement the energy saving measures in all the municipalities across the country', 'they will be supported by technical teams from edi holdings eskom and the national energy efficiency agency', 'the department of provincial and local government will coordinate this activity supported by the line departments of mineral and energy and public enterprises', 'i will convene a meeting of the joint presidential working groups to coordinate our overall actions', 'i will also shortly announce a team of energy champions consisting of prominent and knowledgeable south africans who will assist government with the energy efficiency campaign and inform investors and communities on the actual situation and how they can help to address our current challenges', 'the minister of finance will provide more information in the budget speech on the support that the government will provide for the energy efficiency campaign and to eskom in its build programme', 'we face an emergency but we can overcome the problems in a relatively short period', 'this situation has precipitated the inevitable realisation that the era of very cheap and abundant electricity has come to an end', 'however given our large base of installed generation capacity for a long time to come ours will remain amongst the few economies with affordable electricity', 'we are a minerals resource economy', 'we must therefore continue to support the mining industry', 'it is inevitable that if we are to continue on our growth path as a manufacturing country we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry', 'however it is imperative that all enterprises become more energy efficient', 'indeed energy efficiency itself provides economic opportunity', 'let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building blocks of the essential energy efficient future we dare not avoid', 'let us ensure that all hands are on deck to address the turbulence that has hit us inspired by the approach that our circumstances call for business unusual  this is exactly the same approach we must adopt as we continue to prepare to host the fifa confederations cup in  and the  fifa soccer world cup which will kick off in our country  days from today', 'i mention this important matter here because the current challenges we are facing have led some elsewhere in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these tournaments successfully', 'of course i have absolutely no doubt that we will honour our undertaking to fifa and the world community of soccer players and lovers to create all the necessary conditions for the holding of the best ever fifa soccer world cup tournament', 'the sense that we get across all sectors of south african society and further afield represented by the actual daily progress we are making in terms of our allround preparations is one of  business unusual all hands on deck for  we must ensure that we sustain this approach', 'we are fully aware that a critical element of our preparations should be the building of a strong south african team which will do us and the whole of the football fraternity proud', 'i am certain that the south african football association our coaches led by carlos alberto parreira and the players are aware of the heavy responsibility they carry to prepare a national team of which both we and africa should be proud', 'once more we thank the springboks for showing the way when they won the rugby world cup last year', 'this must inspire bafana bafana as it must inspire our athletes who will compete in the beijing olympic games later this year', 'let me now turn to the apex priorities i mentioned', 'further to accelerate our economic growth and development we will implement the industrial policy action plan', 'government will continue our industrialisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employmentcreation', 'in this regard r billion has been budgeted for industrial policy initiatives and a further r billion in tax incentives over three years will support industrial policy', 'working together with business and labour we shall also develop as urgently as possible key action plans in sectors where such plans do not exist such as mining and minerals beneficiation consumer durables retail with a focus on improving support to small enterprises construction the creative industries agriculture and agroprocessing', 'once more i would like to emphasise that we remain determined to support the automotive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the motor industry development programme is maintained', 'at the macroeconomic level we will continue to maintain a fiscal posture that supports continued economic growth and development and reducing our external vulnerability', 'to speed up the process of building infrastructure we will finalise the development of an integrated infrastructure plan with specific emphasis on energy efficiency', 'this entails coordinating the programmes of the stateowned enterprises and overlaying all the infrastructure plans including freight and other logistics energy pipelines information and communications technology road infrastructure water and electricity both in terms of their timing and geographic location', 'cutting across these plans and therefore a critical priority is information and communications technology both as a facilitator and a sector in its own right', 'accordingly we will this year complete the licensing and operationalisation of infraco', 'already money has been allocated for sentech to become a wireless internet wholesaler as well as finance its digitisation', 'working with other governments on the continent and the private sector we will complete the process to launch the undersea cables', 'at the same time we aim to provide digital broadcasting to  of the population by the end of the year', 'attached to this will be a manufacturing strategy for the development in south africa of set top boxes which should be finalised by the middle of the year', 'having noted that the tardiness with which government processes applications for investment in relation to issues such as land acquisition infrastructure and environmental impact assessments can at times make or break investor decisions we have decided in the spirit of business unusual work is progressing urgently to set up a call centre through which prospective investors and government can track these processes', 'an element of governments apex of priorities will be deliberate focus on matters of skills development', 'work to review the national human resource development strategy will be completed this year and the projects that the joint team of government labour business and academic institutions organised under the joint initiative on priority skills acquisition jipsa will be intensified', 'indeed we are greatly encouraged by the good response from the private sector as demonstrated through the commitment by the ceos of  of the jselisted companies to work with government in addressing the challenge of scarce skills', 'in addition to this work we will in the coming period prioritise further interventions in the further education and training fet colleges the sector education and training authorities setas resourcing schools in the lowest three quintiles freeing them from the responsibility to charge fees and speeding up onthejob training for professional graduates', 'further after correcting weaknesses in our adult basic education programme which we identified last year we shall this month launch the kha ri gude let us learn mass literacy campaign', 'this will include the training of master trainers who will provide basic literacy classes to   adults and youth in ', 'madame speaker and chairperson  at the centre of our economic programmes is and should always be the consideration whether their success is helping to improve the quality of life of all south africans acting as an important weapon in our war on poverty and accelerating our advance towards the attainment of such objectives as the reduction of unemployment and advancing the goal of health for all', 'in the programme to provide sustainable human settlements we are now able to provide   housing units per annum and an agreement has been reached with the south african local government association salga to place a moratorium on the sale of land that can be availed for the housing programme', 'along with the progress we are making in the variety of interventions focused on poverty reduction we continue to address a number many weaknesses including the processing of the land use management bill the finalisation of the land restitution cases the support programme for those who acquire land and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme', 'these are some of the issues to which we will pay special attention during this year and ensure that we meet the targets we have set ourselves', 'yet another critical apex priority is the elaboration of an integrated and comprehensive antipoverty strategy that addresses especially sections of the population most affected by this scourge', 'these include children women the youth people living in rural areas and urban informal settlements people with disabilities or chronic illnesses and the elderly', 'among the key proposed interventions are expanding the public works programme employment subsidies for direct jobcreation for targeted groups enhancing employment search capability improving education and training improving services and assets among poor communities specific interventions in poor households and ensuring effectiveness of institutions supporting women and other sectors', 'among others we will make an evaluation of the gender machinery so as to improve all aspects related to women empowerment', 'parallel to this initiative is a special project to examine interventions required to deal with vulnerable children over the age of ', 'but we will all agree that our society and the poor specifically cannot wait for strategies and dialogues and workshops  important as these may be', 'in any case most of the interventions possible are things that government is already doing though not sufficiently integrated', 'as such in the spirit of business unusual government intends this year to intensify the campaign to identify specific households and individuals in dire need and to put in place interventions that will help in the intervening period to alleviate their plight in those individual households', 'for this we will require a national war room for a war against poverty bringing together departments such as social development provincial and local government trade and industry agriculture and land affairs public works and health as well as provincial and local administrations which will work with nongovernmental organisations ngos and business to identify the interventions required in specific households and implement them as a matter of urgency', 'we shall this year attend to other specific priorities which are critical to the countrys war against poverty in pursuit of socioeconomic inclusion', 'these are   speeding up land and agrarian reform with detailed plans for land acquisition better implementation of agricultural support services and household food support and improving the capital base and reach of the microagricultural finance institutions of south africa mafisa to provide microcredit in this sector focus will be placed on areas of large concentrations of farm dwellers and those with high eviction rates and we aim to increase black entrepreneurship in agricultural production by  per year and the audit on land ownership will be speeded up    the budget will provide for an increase in the social grant system by equalising the age of eligibility at  thus benefiting about half a million men    intensifying efforts already started to scale up assistance to cooperatives and small enterprises especially those involving women with emphasis on providing training and markets including linking them up with established outlets    scaling up the national youth service programme including a graduated increase of the intake in the military skills development programme of the south african national defence force sandf from the current   to  ', 'r million has already been given to the sandf to start scaling up this programme    intensifying the expanded public works programme epwp which by surpassing the set targets has shown potential to absorb more entrants this will include increased intake of young people in the programme to maintain public infrastructure doubling the number of children enrolled in early childhood development to over   through   new sites with more than   practitioners trained and employed and increasing the number of caregivers', 'about r billion over the baseline will be allocated to programmes that fall within the epwp  and lastly   introducing the system of products for preferential procurement by government from small medium and microenterprises  and through the small enterprises development agency setting up a rigorous system to ensure that the day payment period is observed', 'we will also integrate the programme to speed up the development of sustainable human settlements with intensified efforts as a matter of urgent priority to accelerate universal access to water sanitation and electricity so that by  we should have decent human settlements and access by all households to these services', 'accelerating our advance towards the achievement of a goal of health for all includes intensified implementation of the national strategic plan against hiv and aids', 'we also aim during the course of this year to reduce tuberculosis tb defaulter rates from  to  train over   health

security system benefiting from the consultations that have started with social partners', 'as we put all our hands on deck and gear ourselves for business unusual we should also intensify national dialogue on the issues that define us as a nation', 'two such issues deserve brief mention', 'the first of these is a proposal that we should develop an oath that will be recited by learners in their morning school assemblies as well as a youth pledge extolling the virtues of humane conduct and human solidarity among all south africans', 'the minister of education will next week elaborate on the national debate on these matters', 'the second issue is about geographic and place names which requires a synchronised process across all provinces so we can create a base slate of changes we propose', 'we will launch this synchronised process soon guided by the south african geographical names council and its provincial committees', 'madame speaker and chairperson  when we reflected on the issue of crime at last years joint sitting of parliament we all expressed grave concern not only at the high rates of crime but also at the indication that things seemed to be turning for the worse especially in respect of murder  bucking the trend of the improvement since the attainment of democracy', 'accordingly last year we engaged in systematic interaction with business and other sectors of the population to develop a holistic approach towards revamping the criminal justice system in its totality', 'in this regard in the spirit of business unusual cabinet has agreed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new modernised efficient and transformed criminal justice system', 'among other things this will entail setting up a new coordinating and management structure for the system at every level from national to local bringing together the judiciary and magistracy the police prosecutors correctional services and the legal aid board as well as other interventions including the empowerment of the community police forums', 'as the honourable members are aware some of these initiatives are already under way  but we are certain that if they are all carried out in an integrated and complementary manner the impact will be that much more effective in our fight against crime', 'the ministers of the justice crime prevention and security cluster will elaborate on the details of this and other initiatives during the course of next week', 'we shall also during the course of this year process the bills on the transformation of the judiciary in consultation with judges and magistrates complete the strategy aimed at strengthening border control and security further give life to the victims charter pay particular attention to the issue of repeat offenders and continue the implementation of additional measures deriving from recommendations of the truth and reconciliation commission', 'informed by the imperative to intensify the offensive against organised crime as well as the recommendations of the khampepe judicial commission on the functioning and location of the directorate of special operations and continuing reflections on this matter including the reform of the criminal justice system we shall by the end of march this year interact with parliament on legislation and other decisive measures required further to enhance our capacity to fight organised crime', 'what will continue to inform us as we take this step will be the absolute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management efficiency and coordination of our lawenforcement agencies', 'of great importance our success in the fight against crime depends on cooperation among all of us as lawabiding citizens inspired by the principles of rule of law respect for our judiciary and pursuit of equal human rights which our constitution enjoins us to observe in our daily lives and pronouncements', 'honourable members  we will continue this year with efforts to improve the machinery of government so that it meets its obligations to citizens', 'if anything the spirit of business unusual should apply to all individuals who carry the privilege of being public servants', 'there are simple but urgent and critical priorities we will attend to as part of the overall effort to improve the organisation and capacity of the state', 'firstly it has been agreed across all spheres of government that especially the critical vacancies should be filled within six months of such openings emerging', 'the department of public service and administration will set up a monitoring system to track the implementation of this decision', 'secondly by may of every year and within two months of the beginning of the financial year at local government level all senior managers should have filed their key performance agreements with relevant authorities', 'the office of the public service commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard', 'thirdly recognising that the department of home affairs touches the core of every citizens life we will this year intensify the implementation of the turnaround strategy approved by cabinet', 'this includes improving the information technology it systems training of staff on the new systems rooting out corrupt elements and piloting the new id card', 'improvement of performance in the public service also depends on the quality of leadership provided by the executive and senior management', 'further it is critical to enhance the commitment of public employees to their duties  a task that belongs to the leadership the public servants themselves and the trade union movement', 'in this regard this year in consultation with public sector unions we will convene a public sector summit to thrash out these issues so that the spirit of batho pele can find concrete expression wherever a government service is provided', 'working with other social partners we shall ensure that by the end of this year the second national anticorruption programme is adopted and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented', 'at local government level we shall assist the first  of our municipalities to develop anticorruption strategies', 'we shall continue this year to intensify efforts to strengthen local government capacity in line with the year local government strategic agenda', 'to ensure systematic monitoring in this regard salga has agreed to provide quarterly reports on the work being done', 'in order further to improve the service being provided to vulnerable sectors such as veterans women and youth we shall review the structures delegated to carry out these functions and examine the most appropriate arrangements including the evaluation of the government structures specifically established to focus on youth development and empowerment', 'many of the challenges in our work which we have identified derive from serious weaknesses in terms of our planning', 'thus as part of our apex priorities in the coming period we will complete the processes that will enable us to enhance governments capacity to put in place realistic and integrated plans covering all spheres of government', 'honourable members  the programme that we have outlined incorporates the commitments that our country has agreed with the leadership of the continent through the african peer review mechanism', 'our focus in promoting the african agenda this year will be on the strengthening of the african institutions including the african union and its development programme nepad', 'this we shall do inspired by the common aspiration of the peoples of the continent for greater integration in pursuit of continental unity at all levels', 'a critical step in this regard is the consolidation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achieving regional integration', 'we continue to be committed to a free trade area in the southern african development community sadc and hope to use our chairpersonship of sadc in  further to give impetus to the regional endeavours in this regard', 'it is in this context as well that we shall continue our bilateral and multilateral interactions with our neighbours and the european union within the context of the process led by the african union au to ensure that the negotiations on the economic partnership agreement are completed as soon as possible premised on accelerating the development of our region', 'over the past year we carried out the mandate of sadc to assist the political leadership of zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the political challenges they face', 'we had an opportunity on the fringes of the au summit in addis ababa formally to present a comprehensive report to the leadership of sadc on this matter', 'in short the parties involved in the dialogue have reached full agreement on all matters relating to the substantive matters the parties had to address', 'these include issues relating to the constitution security media and electoral laws and other matters that have been in contention for many years', 'the relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by parliament including the necessary constitutional amendments', 'what is outstanding however is a procedural matter relating to the timing and the manner of enactment of the new agreed draft constitution', 'accordingly we join the sadc heads of state and government in congratulating the parties to the zimbabwe dialogue for their truly commendable achievements and encourage them to work together to resolve the remaining procedural matter', 'as requested by the sadc heads of state and government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the zimbabwe negotiations', 'at the same time we wish the people of zimbabwe success in the elections scheduled for the th of march', 'our multifaceted relations with the democratic republic of congo will continue as we seek to contribute to the efforts of the sister people of that country to attain lasting peace and implement their reconstruction and development programme', 'our government will remain seized of the processes under way in kenya chad burundi darfur in the sudan western sahara cte divoire somalia the comoros and the central african republic to find lasting peace and stability', 'we are particularly concerned by the senseless violence and killings in both kenya and chad developments that clearly set back the progress we have been making in the last few years with regard to the regeneration of the african continent', 'we call on all african compatriots to do whatever we can together to help bring a stop to all these negative developments', 'we will of course continue to carry out our tasks in the united nations security council', 'critical in this regard is the strengthening of cooperation between the un security council and the peace and security council of the african union', 'impelled by the desire to promote the improvement in the quality of life of all peoples particularly in the developing countries we shall focus on further strengthening our participation in the indiabrazilsouth africa forums the new africaasia strategic partnership the nonaligned movement the group of  and negotiations to complete the sacumercusor trade agreement', 'in the same measure we shall continue to contribute to the realisation of the objectives of the kyoto protocol on climate change and ongoing improvements in this regard and in giving further impetus to the negotiations on the wto doha development round', 'this year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between south africa and the peoples republic of china', 'the mushrooming of relations in a variety of areas between our governments and peoples confirms that the chinasouth africa partnership for growth and development is a strategic relationship of mutual benefit which can only grow from strength to strength', 'next year south africa will play host to the review conference to evaluate the implementation of the decisions of the world conference against racism which was held in our country in ', 'we are confident that informed by their abhorrence of the scourge of racism and the devastating consequences it continues to exact on humanity the governments and peoples of the world will work together with us to ensure that the review conference achieves its objectives', 'these global responsibilities including the hosting of the  fifa soccer world cup bring out in even bolder relief the confidence that humanity has in our country as a strategic player in the noble endeavours of all humanity', 'but we should not take this for granted', 'i am confident that under the leadership of the international marketing council trade and investment south africa tisa tourism south africa and other agencies we shall all put our hands on deck to communicate to the rest of the world the spirit of business unusual and our continuing advance towards the creation of a society that cares and the conditions for the world to gather in our country to celebrate africas humanity in ', 'madame speaker chairperson and honourable members   having said all that i have said i come back to the question what is the state of our nation as we enter   what i do know and hereby make bold to say is whatever the challenges of the moment we are still on course  i say this with unshakeable conviction because i am certain that south africans are capable and geared to meet the challenge of history  to strain every sinew of our being  to respond to the national challenges of the day including those relating to our economy the political and economic situation in africa and elsewhere in the world and seize the opportunities that our countrys progress over the last fourteen years has provided', 'with all hands on deck and committed to conduct our business in an unusual and more effective fashion we shall sustain the process of our reconstruction and development and take it to even higher levels', 'thank you']"

provincial governments to identify investable projects and ensure that we build investment books for each of our nine provinces to present to potential investors', 'following our successful investment conference a group of south african business leaders moved by the spirit of thuma mina initiated the publicprivate growth initiative to facilitate focused investment plans of leading companies across

in limpopo in  and lumka mkethwa from luna junior primary school in the eastern cape who lost her life in march last year', 'we conducted an audit last year and found that nearly  schools still have inappropriate sanitation facilities', 'given the scale and urgency of the problem we launched the safe initiative in august last year through which we mobilised all available resources including pledges from business strategic partners and the building industry to replace all unsafe toilets in public schools', 'since we launched the initiative  schools have been provided with safe and

want our soes to be fully selfsufficient and be able to fulfil their development and economic role', 'where soes are not able to raise sufficient financing from banks from capital markets from development finance institutions or from the fiscus we will need to explore other mechanisms such as strategic equity partnerships or selling off nonstrategic assets', 'as we do all this we will not

provide further details on this in the budget speech', 'this we will do without burdening the fiscus with unmanageable debt', 'to ensure the credibility of the turnaround plan and avoid a similar financial crisis in a few years time eskom will need to develop a new business model', 'this business model needs to take into account the root causes of its current crisis and the profound

proclamation of the election date to register', 'fellow south africans  we are a people of resilience of determination and of optimism', 'despite the worst excesses of apartheid we did not descend into vengeance when our freedom was won', 'our democracy has blossomed and flourished nurtured by the goodwill of the men and women of this great land who understand only too well at what cost it was attained', 'but the road towards true freedom is a long one and we have seen divisions in our society grow', 'between black and white rich and the poor between rural and urban between the sexes and between language groups and cultures', 'at times it has seemed that the milk of human kindness that allowed us to reconcile in  had gone sour', 'but we will not surrender to the forces of pessimism and defeatism', 'our society is anchored in the roots of tolerance and coexistence and we stand firm resolute and united against all and everything that seeks to divide us or destroy our hardwon gains', 'they told us building a nonracial south africa was impossible and that we would never be able to truly heal from our bitter past', 'yet we weathered the storm and we are prevailing', 'it was

we approach these tasks and challenges we should heed the word of theodore roosevelt who said  it is not the critic who counts  not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better', 'the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood  who strives valiantly  who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming  but who does actually strive to do the deeds  who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions  who spends himself in a worthy cause  who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid

chairperson of the national council of provinces  deputy president of the republic  honourable leaders of our political parties and honourable members of parliament  our esteemed chief justice and members of the judiciary  heads of our security services  governor of the reserve bank  president mandela and mrs graca machel  president jean bertrand aristide and madame aristide  president of the pan african parliament the hon gertrude mongella  ministers and deputy ministers  premiers and leaders of salga mayor of cape town and other leaders in our system of local government  our honoured traditional leaders  heads of the state organs supporting our democratic system  directorsgeneral heads of our state corporations and other leaders of the public service  your excellencies ambassadors and high commissioners  distinguished guests friends and comrades  people of south africa  as we open this second session of our third democratic parliament which will straddle the end of the first and the beginning of the second decade of democracy i am privileged to say that as a people we have every reason to be proud of our historic achievements during our first decade of democracy', 'central to these achievements is our success in advancing our country away from its divided past towards the realisation of the vision contained in the freedom charter  whose th anniversary we celebrate this year  that south africa belongs to all who live in it black and white', '  of significant interest in this regard is the fact that this year we also commemorate the th anniversary of one of the most infamous forced removals in our country  the destruction of sophiatown in johannesburg and its transformation into a white group area renamed triomf the triumph of white supremacy', 'this horrible act of violence against a people made the unequivocal and practical statement that the government of the day was determined to communicate the understanding that south africa did not belong to all who live in it', 'but as the honourable members know our constitutionmakers incorporated in the  constitution the alternative vision adopted at the congress of the people during the same year of the destruction of sophiatown as reflected in the freedom charter', 'our constitution therefore states that we the people of south africa believe that south africa belongs to all who live in it united in our diversity', '  as a consequence of the victories we have registered during our first ten years of freedom we have laid a firm foundation for the new advances we must and will make during the next decade', 'this foundation must help us to move even further forward towards the consolidation of national reconciliation national cohesion and unity and a shared new patriotism born of the strengthening of the manifest reality of a south africa that belongs to all who live in it united in their diversity', 'it must help us to take the detailed practical steps to achieve better results today and tomorrow than we did yesterday', 'this means that during each one of the years that make up our second decade of liberation including this one we must achieve new and decisive advances towards  the further entrenchment of democracy in our country  transforming our country into a genuinely nonracial society  transforming our country into a genuinely nonsexist society  eradicating poverty and underdevelopment within the context of a thriving and growing first economy and the successful transformation of the second economy  opening the vistas towards the spiritual and material fulfilment of each and every south african  securing the safety and security of all our people  building a strong and efficient democratic state that truly serves the interests of the people  and contributing to the victory of the african renaissance and the achievement of the goal of a better life for the peoples of africa and the rest of the world', 'these objectives constitute the central architecture of our policies and programmes intended to ensure that south africa truly belongs to all who live in it black and white', 'madame speaker we are privileged to have among us as on previous occasions our distinguished chief justice judge arthur chaskalson', 'i regret to say that this is the last time he will be with us in these houses of parliament as our chief justice', 'early last year the chief justice reminded me that  february  three days from today will mark the th anniversary of the inauguration of our constitutional court', 'he felt then that ten years was a long time for one person to hold office as the head of our apex court as he has done', 'he therefore thought it right and proper that he should take advantage of the beginning of the second decade of the constitutional court to retire from the bench', 'we agreed that we should meet again at the beginning of this year to consider this matter which we have now done', 'chief justice chaskalson has convinced me that his own determination to continue to contribute to the birth of our nation rather than personal considerations dictates that he should relinquish his high post', 'i have listened carefully to his moving argument and was similarly moved to agree to his request', 'we have therefore agreed that he will be discharged from active service in our judiciary on the st of may this year', 'consequently i will take the necessary steps to consult the judicial service commission and the leaders of the political parties represented in our national parliament to determine who will be our next chief justice from the st of june this year', 'i am privileged to have the opportunity on this important occasion on our national calendar to convey our thanks to and salute a great son of our people chief justice arthur chaskalson', 'i trust that later this year parliament will give all of us an opportunity to bid this giant among the architects of our democracy the fitting farewell that the constraints of time today prohibit', 'on behalf of the nation i am honoured to convey our humble thanks to you chief justice arthur chaskalson for everything you have done as a south african a lawyer and a judge to shepherd us towards the construction of a south africa that truly belongs to all who live in it', 'madame speaker  also among us both as honourable members and guests are the volunteers who trudged the expanse of our country more than five decades ago to gather the views of south africans with regard to the kind of alternative society they wished to see which culminated in the congress of the people held  years ago that adopted the freedom charter', 'it is a tribute to their foresight courage and humanism that the product of their labours the freedom charter finds its reflection in the basic law of our land our constitution', 'one of those volunteers is with us today', 'we are happy today to express the gratitude of the nation to madoda nsibande and others', 'also among us is john nkadimeng a volunteer himself and founderleader of the south african congress of trade unions sactu which was formed  years ago', 'we also have with us chris dlamini representing the corps of workerleaders who brought together various unions to establish cosatu  years ago the bearer of the baton of progressive trade unionism in our country', 'through their efforts which we acknowledge in this chamber today john nkadimeng chris dlamini and their colleagues ensured that we can today say with pride that south africa belongs also to all the working people of our country', 'allow me madame speaker also to acknowledge the late gavin relly zac de beer and tony bloom who led the delegation that braved the threats and scorn of the then apartheid regime to meet oliver tambo and other leaders of the liberation movement in lusaka in ', 'i would also like to pay tribute to the late kobie coetsee who  years ago initiated the first contact between the apartheid regime and nelson mandela which led among other things to the release of nelson mandela  years ago today', 'we further acknowledge the family of the artist thami mnyele one of those who  years ago was killed in his sleep by soldiers of the sadf who carried out an act of aggression in gaborone botswana targeting those of our people it had driven into exile', 'also among us in this chamber today is helena dolny representing the family of joe slovo who passed away  years ago', 'as all of us know in addition to everything else he did as an architect of our democracy joe slovo started the programme that would make the homeless feel that south africa belongs to them as well', 'we are honoured that these esteemed south africans have taken time to be with us today to give us the privilege to salute them and their loved ones', 'like angel jones and marina smithers of the homecoming revolution we know very well that today our country and continent provide the best and most promising locations for the solution of many of the problems that trouble the whole of humanity', 'all of us face the task to respond to this historic challenge', 'madame speaker   in may last year in the aftermath of our third democratic elections we set out the programme of action of government to achieve higher rates of economic growth and development improve the quality of life of all our people and consolidate our social cohesion', 'we did this confident that the progress we had made in the first decade of freedom provided the platform for us to move forward faster with better quality of outputs and better outcomes in building a society that cares', 'with regard to the economy a recent report of the rand merchant bank prepared by the economist rudolf gouws says  real domestic output growth accelerated through last year to reach an annualised  per cent in the third quarter  a rate last seen in   with contributions coming from all sectors of the economy', 'in terms of economic growth south africa has long been underperforming its emergingmarket peer group but the newfound higher growth path is bringing the country more in line with other successful emergingmarket nations', '', 'the current economic upswing which began in september  is not only the longest upward phase of the business cycle in the postwwii period but should also be sustainable into the future', 'one of the reasons is that the economy is in the process of changing from one driven predominantly by consumption government as well as households to one driven to a greater degree by fixed investment', 'as a consequence of the stronger growth the employment picture in south africa has gradually begun to improve', 'while south africa certainly still has a major unemployment problem there are encouraging signs', '  gouws comments on what he calls governments good trackrecord of implementing prudent fiscal policies and continues  but the improvements in overall government finances were not brought about primarily to please the financial markets and the rating agencies but rather to ensure that government is able to deliver services to the population in a sustainable way', 'concurrent with the turnaround in public finances were important institutional changes and improvements in the ability of government to deliver', '  he concludes by saying that  faster growth coupled with efforts to improve the environment for doing business and addressing the plight of the poor more effectively means improved chances for a sustainable improvement in the general welfare of all south africans', '  we agree with the observations made by rudolf gouws', 'indeed because of the factors he mentioned we have for instance with  coverage of most social grants almost met the objective we set for ourselves in  of ensuring that all who are eligible for these grants receive them within three years', 'last december we passed the million mark in terms of south africans who have gained access to potable water since ', 'free basic water of  kilolitres per household per month is now being provided to about threequarters of households in the areas of our country that have the infrastructure to supply potable water', 'since  close to  million housing subsidies have been allocated to the poor', 'education remains our largest single budgetary item with primary school enrolment rates remaining steady at about  since  and secondary school enrolments currently at ', 'the gross annual value of the social wage was about r billion in  with the poor being the largest beneficiaries', 'the democratic state will not walk away from its obligation to come to the aid of the poor bearing in mind available resources', 'in this context we must also refer to the latest report of the unisa bureau of market research on national personal income of south africans by population group income group life stage and lifeplane ', 'among other things this report says in   million out of  million households in south africa lived on an income of r  and less per year', 'this decreased to   million households in  even after taking the negative effect of price increases on spending power into account', 'on the other hand the number of households receiving a real income of r  and more per annum rose from   in  to more than  million in ', '  the additional social expenditures we have mentioned demonstrate what rudolf gouws was referring to when he said that the the improvements in overall government finances were brought about to ensure that government is able to deliver services to the population in a sustainable way', 'on the other hand reflecting on one element of the programme that we announced last may  the issue of school infrastructure  the editor of city press said correctly that   the backlog of classrooms still runs into several thousand nationwide', 'we believe that addressing the crisis in education is perhaps the most urgent priority', 'the march deadline will not be met', 'government must work out a plan that will ensure the speedy delivery of classrooms to all', '  overall our own detailed assessment of the implementation of our programme of action reveals that of the  concrete actions contained in the governments programme some of which we announced in the last state of the nation address   of those with specific time frames have been undertaken or are being undertaken within the deadlines we set   have been or are being undertaken though there were slight delays in terms of the time frames that we had set ourselves   have not been fully carried out and the reasons behind the delays are such that new deadlines will have to be set for their accomplishment', 'in other words  of these programmes are being carried out within the broad framework of the time frames we had set ourselves', ' of the concrete actions that did not have specific time frames are progressing as envisaged while  show some delays that call for urgent attention by government', 'i wish to thank our colleagues in cabinet the provincial executives and municipal executive councils the public service as well as the leadership of our social partners who have put shoulders to the wheel to ensure that we carry out that which is expected of us jointly and severally to meet our common national objectives', 'we also highly appreciate the oversight role as well as the direct contribution in the crucible of actual implementation of our public representatives in all the three spheres of government', 'we are confident that honourable members will persist in this service to the people so as to improve our work allround', 'what then is the programme of government for the year and how shall we build on the work done in the past decade in general and the past nine months in particular', 'as honourable members will know the details of the actions in each of last years programmatic areas have been published on the government website', 'i shall therefore only identify the major issues in terms of our past work and then outline some of the things that need to be done in the coming year', 'with regard to interventions to grow the first economy the broad objectives we set ourselves remain the same', 'we will continue our consultations with our social partners to ensure that our economy continues to steam ahead as rudolf gouws predicted', 'our programme for the coming year is premised on the broad objectives to increase investment in the economy lower the cost of doing business improve economic inclusion and provide the skills required by the economy', 'therefore the details outlined in may last year to the extent that the tasks are ongoing remain an integral part of the programme', 'on infrastructure we have since may  developed strategies and investment plans upward of rbillion in relation to transport logistics electricity and water resources', 'we would like to cite only two instances in this regard', 'transnet has already approved business plans for new investments in the durban and cape town harbours as well as the construction of a new pipeline between durban and johannesburg', 'as it brings three previously decommissioned power stations into operation eskom will add r billion to the gdp by  with new jobs created peaking during the same year at  ', 'we have also taken steps the better to manage administered prices through the actions of independent regulators as well as through more rigorous monitoring which will see an administered prices index produced by the official statisticians from the first quarter of this year', 'discussions continue with the steel and chemical industries in particular to reach agreement on the issue of import parity pricing', 'government has decided to avoid using legislation or regulations even in the face of these obvious market failures', 'we believe that there is growing consensus among economic roleplayers with regard to what we are seeking to do', 'this is to ensure that working with especially the producers of inputs that are strategic for economic growth we find a resolution to this matter in a manner that addresses the interests of both these producers and the downstream industries', 'bold steps have been taken further to liberalise the telecommunications industry', 'we believe that the unacceptable situation in which some of our fixed line rates are  times those of developed oecd countries will soon become a thing of the past', 'we also hope that the delays in setting up the second national operator arising from legal processes which are beyond governments control will be resolved in due course and as soon as possible', 'further work has been done to improve the work of defining and implementing sectoral charters as agreed at the growth and development summit in ', 'in this regard i especially and warmly welcome the decision of the south african banks to implement the provisions of the financial sector charter as a result of which they have made a public threeyear commitment to provide at least r billion to finance lowcost housing infrastructure black small business enterprises and new black farmers', 'elements of the codes of good practice for broadbased black economic empowerment have been released for public comment and once this process is finalised it will then be possible to appoint the black economic empowerment council', 'related to these efforts is the progress made in setting up the small enterprise development agency to improve our governments performance in the critical area of the development of small and medium enterprises', 'with the commitments from the private sector as demonstrated by the banks it is clear that together as south africans we are set to make a determined effort to speed up broadbased black economic empowerment and small business development', 'in this regard i would like to mention and welcome the announcement made by the ceo of anglo american south africa lazarus zim in the last few days indicating the large resources his company will spend to empower a great number of black enterprises', 'to ensure properly focused development planning cabinet is working to align the national spatial development perspective with the provincial growth and development strategies and the municipal integrated development plans', 'to increase the numbers of skilled workers we have met the target set by the growth and development summit and trained more than   learners', 'we have also released the draft immigration regulations for public comment', 'it is however clear that more work will have to be done to raise the skills levels of our people', 'accordingly the government has approved a new national skills development strategy for the period ', 'r billion over five years will be allocated to fund this strategy which will include improved cooperation between the setas on one hand and the further training and education colleges and the institutions of higher education on the other', 'at the same time we have taken note of the reasons for the delay in implementing some of the announced programmes', 'these include the complexities of the tasks to be carried out the rigour required in planning and implementing these actions across all the spheres the magnitude of resources demanded and the subjective capacity of the implementing agents where at least financial resources were made available', 'in this regard government will ensure that the outstanding tasks are attended to within the next three months', 'these are  finalising the governmentwide review of performance practices in stateowned enterprises  finalising discussions especially in the context of the financial sector charter on investing  of investible capital of financial institutions in productive

this becomes and is seen to become a reality', 'during the past nine months we started to put the expanded public works programme into operation', 'to date we have spent over r  billion created over

year to meet our longterm objectives such as the provision of clean running water to all households by  decent and safe sanitation by  and electricity for all by ', 'we do acknowledge that there have been delays in carrying out some of the programmes', 'further effort will be put into clearing the logjams', 'with regard to the provision of safe classrooms for instance we had committed ourselves in  to ensure that within three years no child studied under a tree', 'as the editor of city press suggested our schools infrastructure programme will not be realised even within the set time frame',

implications of this research on policy and if necessary relevant decisions will be taken to enhance our work in strengthening social cohesion', 'honourable members   as we indicated last may we have set out to ensure that during the second decade of freedom we improve the machinery of government so that wherever we are each one of us is inspired to act as servants of the people', 'as we have

to build school infrastructure are unfolding at a much slower pace than envisaged', 'the public sector as a whole cannot claim to be such if the benefits of free basic electricity are accruing mainly to those who are relatively well off', 'that only  of the municipal infrastructure grant had been allocated to municipalities by december is a reflection of lack of allround capacity particularly in technical areas with regard to water sanitation and public works projects', 'and the laborious decisionmaking process is not helping either', 'we can refer to the provision of services across all the spheres or weaknesses in the implementation of the urban renewal and rural development programmes and the conclusion will be the same', 'we need massively to improve the management organisational technical and other capacities of government so that it meets its objectives', 'in this regard the following programme will be implemented during the course of the coming year  by may the forum of sa directorsgeneral will submit to cabinet a thorough review of the functioning of the government system as a whole and make proposals particularly on the capacity of the implementing agents skills and competence within the public service alignment of planning and implementation and issues pertaining to the mobilisation of the public service to speed up social transformation', 'by the end of the year an improved batho pele campaign including unannounced site visits name badges and enhanced internal communication within the public service will be visibly asserted', 'in this regard we need to have an ongoing national programme to entrench the ethos of letsema and vukuzenzele among all our people and ensure that these values permeate the work of government business labour and communities', 'in this context we must also make a determined effort to educate our population that our country does not have the resources immediately to meet simultaneously all the admittedly urgent needs of our people especially the poor', 'all of us must understand the stark reality that even illegal violent demonstrations will not produce these resources and will be met with the full force of the law', 'at

transformation of south african society and in the context of the obligation to meet the requirements of our laws the private sector will do the same', 'collectively we need to fight the tendency to act according to particular stereotypes described so succinctly by steven friedman an analyst at the centre for policy studies  in business and the professions too deeply pervasive prejudices decide who has ability and who not', 'it is dressed up as support for merit and it infests the thinking of many who believe genuinely that they are not prejudiced', 'and the effect in lost performance loss of selfesteem and anger from the thwarted is much the same', 'it may well cost us far more lost growth and achievement than all the other factors we often cite', '  within  months a summit on

appreciated by all lawabiding south africans and that we shall continue to work with them to protect the security and dignity of all who live in south africa', 'the progress that we are making in

decline by  theft of motor vehicles and motor cycles by  common robbery by  cashintransit heists by  and bank robberies by  should continue and in fact improve in subsequent years', 'yes there are crimes such as aggravated robbery and child abuse which show an increase', 'yes the level of crime especially violent incidents remains unacceptable', 'but we are confident of meeting our target to

provinces  honourable members of parliament  distinguished guests  ladies and gentlemen  i should start by expressing my appreciation for this opportunity to exchange views with you at the beginning of this penultimate sitting of our first democratic parliament', 'i wish all of you a productive new year in the service of the people', 'as government we are confident of the progress being made to meet our mandate', 'we are resolved to build on the solid foundation that has been laid over the past threeandahalf years', 'as always the most critical challenge is whether we are succeeding as leaders to mobilise the people in actual practice to be their own liberators', 'we know too well that on our own we cannot succeed', 'we know that the programmes of government are not the panacea for all the ills of our terrible past', 'they are but a platform for south africans to let their strengths shine through', 'by our own pronouncements and actions we could relate to these citizens as passive recipients of government delivery as if government were a force on high', 'worse still we could turn some constituents into passive critics their own rationality drowned in the chorus of regret that the past has passed', 'on both counts this would be a recipe for sure failure', 'that is why during the course of last year we once again put the masakhane campaign at the centre of our activities', 'and our performance should be judged above all on the basis of whether our programmes are positively affecting the lives of especially the most vulnerable sections of society the poor women the disabled children and the rural masses  the primary victims of the iniquitous system from which we have just emerged', 'we are proud to answer this question in the affirmative', 'last year we increased the supply of clean and accessible water from  thousand to  million south africans', 'we have surpassed our plans to build or upgrade  clinics last year  and the primary school feeding scheme reaches million children', 'from  thousand in  we are in line to make  thousand telephone connections this financial year making life that much easier for millions of south africans', 'with more than  thousand electricity connections in  alone today south africa has reached a  electrification level so millions can have light', 'besides the impressive land redistribution programmes the law on secure tenure will bring more certainty in the lives of over six million citizens', 'there is no magic in numbers as such', 'but we are proud that through these and many other projects our programmes are impacting on the lives of particularly the poor', 'this applies to varying degrees with regard to other challenges to which we shall later return', 'and it is all a result of a clear strategy properly managed plans good governance and more than anything else the determination of the overwhelming majority of our countrymen and women to change their lives for the better', 'it is therefore understandable that unlike some of us those who bore the brunt of apartheid oppression say that things are a lot better', 'but they also say and are justified to say so that what has been done is not enough', 'not because they expect the legacy of centuries of colonialism to be eradicated in a few years as we ourselves have said on countless occasions before', 'not because they are frustrated with government', 'but because they appreciate that together we need to much more over many years to realise a truly just and prosperous government they have a serious committed and caring institution  a government that they can call their own', 'we are at the beginning of an arduous and protracted struggle for a better quality of life', 'in the course of this struggle we shall have immediate successes  we shall have setbacks  but we shall certainly progress inch by inch towards our goal', 'from time to time incidents do happen which bring out in bold relief the enormity of the challenges we face', 'as the saying goes one falling tree makes more noise than millions that are growing', 'as such for both good reason and bad occasional problems are seized upon by our detractors as the stockintrade of this government  indeed as the essence of democracy', 'i will raise a few of them particularly difficulties with regard to old age pensions education crime and corruption housing and jobcreation because they touch on the very essence of the issues of resources to meet our obligations the size of the public service and its management civic duty and a new morality', 'madame speaker   a few weeks ago the problem of disbursement of old age pensions and other social grants came to the fore', 'let me start off by saying that in the way that we increased old age pensions last year and as we eliminate fraud we shall seek to find resources this year for a further increase  modest as it may be  working towards a life of dignity for our senior citizens', 'let me further emphasise that we are committed  not merely because of statutory obligations but because we care  to ensure that whatever the occasional administrative hiccups the right to a pension will always be met', 'what has not received much public coverage is the fact that the problems we experienced recently derived from   firstly that the audit of our newly integrated system is not only eliminating ghosts  but it also identified people who were callously refused these pensions under the apartheid system and its bantustan offshoots', 'they are today on the roll  and it was decided that their right to backpay could not be disregarded', ' secondly the measures that have been taken to eliminate corruption have uncovered many fraudsters in the government machinery but we still have a long way to go to resolve this problem', ' thirdly some public servants are to put it mildly not imbued with the spirit of public service  to the extent that even in instances where these funds are available they do not turn up on time andor they relate to senior citizens with attitudes bordering on the criminal', 'through cooperation between national and provincial movements concerned we shall ensure that these problems are dealt with methodically and with a ruthless determination', 'related to this we did indicate last year that we expected some teething problems in the first year of total budget allocations to the provinces', 'indeed we need to pause here to pay tribute to the provincial administrations which were able to come through without debilitating desolation', 'given the serious problems identified by central government task teams last year it is thanks to the efforts of all provinces without exception that the problems have not been much worse', 'but we must eliminate overspending', 'a related and critical matter is the issue of how the public resources at our disposal correspond with the social backlog that we have inherited', 'in our view the starting point in addressing the question of the national budget and public finances in general is that we cannot behave like fools who cut their noses to spite their faces to throw policy out of the window in search of fractions of percentages in deficit targets', 'we have creatively to strive to meet our obligations within the context of a reduction of the public debt', 'indeed we cannot pretend that the deficit targets we have set ourselves do not test our capacity and will', 'but we cannot divert from the course we have chosen', 'there is no other route to sustainable development', 'two critical matters arise from this', 'in the first two years of our democracy we sought to use the special mechanism of a socalled rdp fund to lever changes in the patterns of departmental spending', 'today this task is built into the normal functions of all departments', 'reprioritisation and more reprioritisation is the challenge that we shall continue to grapple with in the coming years', 'for if we should not and cannot cut down on houses and clinics being built on the supply of water on improving the quality of education including the building and equipping of schools on improving policing and so on then we have to cut down elsewhere', 'there have been some commendable savings from better cash flow management', 'but it is not nearly enough', 'and we cannot use the proceeds of privatisation to fund salaries and other consumption expenditure', 'put in simple terms we need to cut spending on personnel', 'i am confident that all of us and the trade union movement in particular will agree that apartheid south africa was overgoverned and oversupervised', 'the size of the public service had nothing to do with public service', 'on the other hand democratic governance is management of a process whereby people govern themselves', 'government is not an employment agency', 'this year we shall go into this question without equivocation', 'frankly put we shall need to start comprehensive discussions with the unions on retrenchment in accordance with the provisions of our labour laws', 'these negotiations will need to take into account the principle that shedding jobs in the public service does not necessarily have to translate into worsening the problem of unemployment', 'for instance retrenchment packages that include investment capital and tender obligations on the part of government can in fact help expand the job market especially in depressed rural areas', 'we shall as a matter of urgency require our public service department and provinces to work out proposals in this regard', 'jobs jobs and jobs is the clarion call that should guide us', 'we do pride ourselves with the health of our economic fundamentals the declining rate of inflation  the incentives that we introduced which have attracted over rbillion in investments  close on to  projects related to spatial development initiatives such as the maputo corridor which have attracted investments to the tune of about rbillion  the rising graph of productivity  and increased exports', 'with regard to the budget we have introduced transparency and certainty through the mediumterm expenditure framework', 'and tax collection is improving as more people are brought into the net', 'we can quote many more examples including a relatively stable exchange rate in the face of global adversity  and the hundreds of thousands of jobs created through the public works municipal infrastructure and investment promotion programmes', 'but the economy continues to shed too many jobs', 'this is in part because the rate of investment particularly by ourselves as south africans is not enough', 'within an overall increase in fixed investments of about  public authorities show a massive decline in the ratio of growth of capital expenditure', 'public corporations are doing much better and they need to be commended for this', 'the rate of growth of productive private investments has not been impressive', 'as such we should all agree that the issue is not merely one of government creating a favourable environment to attract investments', 'this it has done with commendable determination', 'what is required is a deliberate effort to increase investments the type of investments which create jobs', 'these are the things i am told that the various sectors in nedlac are addressing in preparation for the jobs summit', 'by the time of this summit we hope that a real partnership will have emerged among government business and labour to tackle this critical task', 'one will not be exaggerating to say that given its impact on everything else we do as a nation including crime prevention reconciliation and the very survival of our democracy the jobs summit is perhaps the most important event since our first democratic elections  an important launching pad for a determined national drive as we move into the st century', 'it is quite clear that as we finalise preparations for this summit we cannot continue to imprison ourselves in the paradigm of large profits and only large profits as the driving force of business operations', 'we cannot continue to wallow in the illusion that the protection of the narrow interests of the employed is the driving force to poverty alleviation', 'we must launch joint efforts towards an economy that creates jobs  towards a society that cares by helping the unfortunate in its ranks to help themselves', 'honourable members and delegates   within the context of facilitating economic growth transfer of technology and black empowerment we have made great progress in the programme to restructure state assets', 'as we promised a the last opening of parliament the previous year has seen telkom acquire strategic partners  sunair has been privatised  south african airways is completing its restructuring towards acquiring a strategic partner', 'while the airports company and safcol processes are taking longer than anticipated they are on their way to completion this year', 'the pace in the restructuring programme is broadly in keeping with our set time frames', 'where difficulties have been experienced they represent lessons both about our past and our present', 'with the aventura holiday resorts for instance a government of the people could not ignore the complex land claims that are attached to some of these resorts', 'with alexkor in diamond mining we once again learnt that much information about the net worth of many state assets has been concealed by those who ran the previous government or they simply did not care about these assets', 'but we are on course to resolve the problems', 'i wish once more to reiterate that for us the issue of restructuring of state assets is not driven by ideology', 'we shall privatise where necessary', 'but we shall also set up new state enterprises where market imperfections and failures play themselves out to undermine social programmes', 'such is the case with elements of the liquid fuels industry and the servicing of housing construction which has not received the optimum support from the banking industry', 'restructuring also means strengthening management of existing enterprises a programme that we have intensified', 'on the issue of housing in particular it is necessary to go back to the basics', 'the numbers of close on to  thousand subsidised houses either completed or under construction and about  thousand subsidies allocated are important indicators of progress', 'but as we indicated earlier there is no magic in numbers as such and the target of  million houses in five years provided directly by government may not be attained', 'what we need to examine closely is whether after the delays in the launch of the housing programme in  we have mustered the capacity to accelerate this programme', 'and the answer is yes  the pace of housing construction is accelerating', 'today one thousand houses are started or completed every twoandahalf days and as a result of our programmes  million south africans have a permanent roof over their head', 'in consultation with some of the banks we have cleared hundreds of socalled redlined areas  we have ensured over  thousand loans at the upper end of the subsidy market  many constructors have been registered  monitoring of quality and the capacity of provinces have been enhanced', 'in addition to issues of quality questions have also been posed about the sizes of houses that are being built', 'going back to the basics here means appreciating that government is focusing on the poor and most vulnerable sectors of society', 'if we have to reach the widest spectrum of these citizens with the resources available we cannot increase the size of the subsidy', 'in addition to services and a plot of land that families can call their own possibilities are left for them to exercise initiative with the resources available and to improve the basic structure when they are in a position to do so', 'indeed among the proudest moments of this programme is the involvement of the people themselves especially women who through their own labour and creativity are able to achieve much more with less', 'in consultation with local government we have also started to examine in greater detail the question of density integrated development and rental accommodation', 'in brief whatever the difficulties and initial delays in the first five years we are on course to ensure that in the end there shall be housing and security for all', 'honourable members and delegates will agree that significant progress has been made in transforming education including adult basic education from the mess it was under apartheid', 'today children starting their schooling can for the first time do so just as children  not a black piccanini or a white kleinbaas', 'from the selfcriticism last year about the schoolbuilding projects we are happy that provinces have started to use more of the funds set aside for this purpose', 'but as in other areas there have been moments in this sphere which bring to the public mind the enormity of the tasks that we face', 'such were the matric results of last year', 'it is encouraging that in typical south african style after the brief flurry of accusations and counteraccusations we started to focus attention on the real issues', 'among these issues is the fact that the standard of the papers was somewhat higher and security of exams somewhat tighter  most inconsequential subjects taken in the past simply to fill a certificate were done away with  the marking was more rigorous and there were minimal adjustment of the marks', 'as such though ironic to say there were fewer but better passes', 'this is not to detract from the fact that we have only scratched at the surface of the legacy of apartheid education', 'many children still study under trees and dilapidated buildings', 'many schools are hollow shells without even the most basic equipment for normal teaching', 'many teachers do not have the capacity to transmit knowledge in a professional manner', 'and some simply do not see it as their civic duty to relocate to areas in need', 'there are inexcusable and unacceptable delays in the supply of textbooks which derive from poor management and shoddy tendering deals  let alone the nonexistence of malfunctioning of many school governing bodies', 'yet when all is said and done many schools in disadvantaged areas have shown that serious application to duty by the school authorities and the students can bring positive results', 'we pay tribute to these heroes', 'madame speaker   this spirit of community of partnership and of hard work is required when dealing with problems of crime and corruption', 'again in this area the tendency often is to exaggerate and distort the real situation  to use halftruths and sensationalism to paint a picture of a situation out of control', 'it is understandable that unscrupulous politicians media commentators and those who wish to question the legitimacy of the democratic process as such will conjure up crises in the heads where in reality there are no crises', 'the task of those interested in improving the countrys quality of life is to examine the real situation in its complex forms even if this may not please the prophets of doom', 'that reality is that since  there has been a marked decline in virtually all serious crimes such as murder robbery taxi violence carhijacking and others', 'in other words since this democratic government came into being there has been a decline in most serious crimes', 'this is a result of better coordination among all arms of the security services the police the intelligence services and the defence force as well as cooperation across southern africa', 'one such example of effective coordination is in the farming areas where there is an  success rate in apprehending the murderers', 'the national crime prevention strategy has got off the ground', 'and as we promised last year the law on bail and mandatory sentences for serious crimes has been passed', 'a detective academy  interestingly the very first one in the history of south africa  has been opened to improve polices investigative capacity and skills to do their jobs', 'proposals on reducing commercial entry points including closing some socalled international airports have been finalised and we hope that we shall receive the cooperation of all affected parties despite the formal agreements that they may have entered into with the previous government', 'among the elements which know how effective the security forces are becoming are the crime syndicates themselves', 'it appears that from time to time and not seldom during crucial political moments they will engage in dramatic acts such as robbery of cashintransit syndicate turf wars and prison escapes', 'but they know better than any politician that the net is closing on them  that the intelligence services are on their heels even if it may take time to build watertight cases against them  that wherever they may be hiding  even in the police and other state structures in the private security companies among prison warders and even the legal fraternity  that even if they may form a web of political forces bent on destabilising our young democracy  they know that their days are numbered', 'the same should be said about corrupt elements who see public service as an opportunity for selfenrichment', 'mechanisms are in place and are being improved all the time to root them out', 'in this regard i wish to thank the media for its vigilance', 'while there may be instances where fingers were pointed at individuals without justification there are a good many examples where investigative journalism has helped us uncover the scoundrels  old and new  who prey on the public purse', 'to find a lasting solution to all these challenges requires a community spirit among all of us a new patriotism which is finding root within the populace', 'we must build our nation into a community of citizens who appreciate their civic duty as each one of us improves our wellbeing', 'we must be ready to give back to society part of what we gain from it', 'in this respect the words of one eminent citizen who has actively joined the campaign against crime are worth repeating in this august assembly  ', 'this country warts and all has been good to me  it is unbelievable', 'it has fed me  it has clothed me  it has educated me  it has given me opportunities in the business world that were unthinkable when i was a kid in brits', 'i think the very least i could do is put something back', 'and this is my kind of national service and i am enjoying it', '  this is a challenge to all of us especially those whose past privileges have afforded them skills that are in high demand in public service to volunteer skills to help improve the lot of the nation', 'indeed on the vexed question of crime we could do more if each south african of integrity consciously ask themselves everyday whether they may have assisted in the commission of crime   as a parent who conceals the activities of a child who is taking drugs without assisting the police to track down the suppliers    as a customer who cooperates in a transaction which allows you a large discount because the seller will not pay vat    as a trade unionist or ordinary worker who turns a blind eye to pilfering on the shopfloor or worse still to corruption in government service    as a politician who stands behind individuals who break the law in the name of challenging bodies such as the truth and reconciliation commission    as a parent or spouse who avoids asking questions when a relative is suddenly awash with money and behaves like a fugitive from justice', 'dont many of us do this and more  and yet express bewilderment at the high rate of crime', 'what this emphasises is that we need a campaign of moral regeneration', 'as we reconstruct the material conditions of our existence we must also change our way of thinking to respect the value and result of honest work and to treat each law of the country as our own', 'this is our call to all south africans to firm up the moral fibre of our nation', 'it is a call to artists and musicians and sportspeople to religious leaders and traditional institutions to intellectuals to the media and to all those who should give leadership as we established new symbols and role models all of us to join hands in a new patriotism  not because the government says so but because it is in our common interest to do it', 'in this regard it is encouraging that the youth of our country through the national youth commission have taken important steps to define a youth policy that will give all  irrespective of the skin colour that is the accident of birth  a stake in our new society', 'particularly heartening is the proposal for youth community service which can be broadened to encompass most of society be it in helping to clean streets volunteering services in schools and so on', 'civic duty is the central purpose behind the masakhane campaign whose awareness week last year was fairly successful', 'we shall continue this year and beyond to intensify this drive including the mobilisation of and assistance to nongovernmental and communitybased organisations who truly have the interests of the community at heart', 'honourable members and delegates   it is to promote the spirit of masakhane that we set up the presidents award for community initiative', 'this annual award honours those who roll up their sleeves and take the initiative to uplift their conditions', 'we are privileged today to have with us as guests of the president representatives of the nine communities that were the first provincial winners', 'selected from some two thousand entries they embody the unquenchable determination of south africans to better their own lives', 'we recognise the buhlebemvelo garden project from kwazulunatal  the ikgodisent sewing project from huhudi  the malungeni training and development centre  the bekkersdal flagship project for unemployed mothers  the dassie preschool centre from oudtshoorn  the khotsong branch of the homeless peoples federation  the nkomazi farmers association the hantam community education trust  and finally the project which was yesterday announced as the national winner of the presidents award for community initiative the mhala development centre in the northern province set up by retrenched mineworkers working with their union and their former employer', 'our congratulations to those whom you represent and indeed to all the  runnersup', 'may the financial prizes from government strengthen your efforts  and may your example inspire others to seek this honour in future years', 'there are also countless others outside the limelight who deserve our admiration and gratitude such as school principal mr mandla hlatshwayo of ndwedwe in kwazulunatal who braved a raging river during torrential rains to deliver matric examination papers to his students  the security guard who risked life and limb singlehandedly to hold highway robbers at bay leading to their arrest  the many sportspeople and other citizens who make us proud to be south african', 'this multifaceted effort to build our society on the basis of a new morality demands that we should be open about mistakes that we committed in the past', 'such is the importance of the truth and reconciliation commission', 'because these mistakes were committed by us so will their airing in public be hurtful and at times embarrassing', 'but the more we know about how low we once sank the more difficult it will be to repeat these mistakes', 'at the hearings of the trc over the past year many horrid details emerged', 'we cannot fail to have been moved by the remorse of some perpetrators and the preparedness of victims to forgive', 'we cannot fail to have been astounded by their very modest appeals for their dignity to be restored', 'but this should not be surprising for their suffering was not for pecuniary gain but for the great prize of freedom and a better life for all', 'the government has heard the appeals for urgent reparations', 'and we shall be ready to provide modest assistance when the details have been forwarded', 'as part of the multiyear budget account will be taken of the needs within our limited resources  and we hope that those who benefited from the suppression of others will find it within themselves to make a contribution', 'as the trc moves towards finalising its work we shall do our best to ensure that their needs are provided for', 'but we know too that this will not be the end but the beginning of the process of reconciliation', 'it is quite unfortunate that some among us still refuse to cooperate with the trc', 'given that part of its task is to unmask the networks that not only violated human rights but also formed one web with crime syndicates the question will haunt such forces forever why it is that they continue to conceal this information we need to make it clear that those who cringe at the banks of the rubicon of truth those who served in state structures and refused to apply for amnesty will not be assisted by the state in the face of whatever consequences accrue to them from their past', 'related to this is the danger of any political leadership and media to continue with the campaign of exploiting the fear uncertainty and anxiety of certain communities about the transition', 'the clamour among some parties to outdo one another in this regard is counterproductive to say the least', 'it worsens polarisation and stokes the fires that have the potential of consuming all of us', 'in any case it is pointless because it will not stop change', 'transformation is this governments reason for existence  and we shall not for a moment shirk our responsibility to the poor', 'this government is humane and we know that the wellbeing of those previously denied their rights is the sure guarantee for the wellbeing of all', 'it is for this reason that it pains me personally when i listen to some of the debates in this chamber', 'always a clear distinction emerges between those who were at the cutting edge of the struggle for freedom who strive for change  and those who implemented of benefited from oppression who seek to block transformation in defence of a modified form of the old order', 'i should take this opportunity to pay homage to the institutions charged with the task of enhancing our democracy and culture of human rights', 'if we say with confidence that south africa will succeed it is in part because we know there is a constitutional court the public protector the human rights commission the electoral commission which has started its challenging work and the auditorgeneral all of which will assist in ensuring that what we do is not only constitutional legal and legitimate but that it is seen to be so by all and sundry including the weakest among us', 'a word of congratulations to the gender commission which has started its work to ensure that our society is true to the principles of consistent equality in everything we do', 'yet this commission and the office on the status of women should not be seen as watchdogs of an alien force bent on doing wrong', 'rather society as a whole should see them as part of our joint efforts as men and women to liberate themselves from gender prejudice', 'we are also encouraged by the systematic work being done regarding the position of the disabled', 'what matters is not merely the thousands of wheelchairs hearing aids and tens of thousands of cataract operations provided in the past year alone  but also ensuring that the attitude in employment practises in discourse in design of infrastructure and more  all these should be changed with the participation of the disabled themselves', 'this year we shall ensure the intensification of the efforts regarding multilingualism in government work and we should thank the pansouth african language board for its vigilance', 'further after extensive consultations during the course of last year we are a step closer towards the setting up of the commission for the promotion and protection of the rights of cultural religious and linguistic communities', 'madame speaker   our programme for this year will once more seek to speed up the improvement of the lives of all with particular emphasis on the most vulnerable and needy', 'some of the additional highlights of this programme whose detail will be announced by the various ministries during the course of next week include  our commitment to meet our budget deficit targets as we further improve the efficiency of tax collection', 'as the further steps we took recently indicated we shall continue on a casebycase basis to lift exchange controls as conditions for such mature', 'construction starts on many maputo development corridor projects  two new development initiatives in the cape west coast and northern kwazulunatal will be launched in the first half of the year', 'work starts in the west to complete the highway across south africa from maputo to walvis bay', 'the basic economy is being revolutionised', 'the integrated tourism programme will be launched in earnest with the potential to create  thousand jobs by the turn of the century', 'in the workplace the departure from apartheid practices will be felt even more keenly as we finalise and implement the bill on employment equity', 'and let us hasten to add in this regard that we shall not be discouraged by the sirens of selfinterest that are being sounded in defence of privilege and the insults that equate women africans indians coloureds and the disabled with a lowering of standards', 'as we have said before affirmative action is corrective action', 'there is no other way of moving away from racial discrimination to true equality', 'we therefore reject campaigns which are based on fear rumour and gossip', 'special attention this year will be paid to the further consolidation of local government with its critical contribution in areas of infrastructure jobcreation small business development and the very legitimacy of democracy', 'we should also take this opportunity to acknowledge local government delegates present her and with them celebrate the beginning of their full participation in the national council of provinces and intergovernmental forums', 'the white paper and new legislation on local government which should be finalised this year will help streamline this sphere of government without derogating from representivity and accountability', 'and to start meeting the requirements of the constitution in the context of poverty alleviation over r billion will this year be equitably and directly allocated to this sphere of government', 'as we attend to these matters particular attention will be paid to continued dialogue with traditional leaders so as to ensure that all of them become full and active partners in the struggle for local development', 'this year also sees the launch of the new government communications and information service which we are certain will contribute to the challenge to improve communication among south africans to afford citizens their rights to information and to air their views', 'our continuing work to reduce incidents of crime will also pay particular attention to women and child abuse crimes which regrettably seem to be on the increase', 'special programmes for the  metropolitan areas which account for the bulk of violent crimes are being finalised for immediate implementation', 'let us once more underline to those who choose to live a life of violent crime that as recent incidents regarding cash heists have shown we shall with the combined might of the security services return fire with overwhelming fire', 'this year we launch the programme that will streamline the judicial system so as to alleviate overcrowding in prisons without creating any new dangers to society', 'above all we shall appoint the national director of public prosecutions and provincial counterparts  a first in the history of our country', 'within the intelligence services it has become even more urgent to unearth the few rotten apples who arrogantly pursue an agenda counter to transformation', 'to put it mildly they are an affront to our security and our pride as a nation  they are a blight on the commendable work that these services are doing to defend democracy', 'we are proud that after a year of so of healthy and informative debate we can now start the protracted process of reequipping our national defence force', 'we wish to congratulate the armed forces and economic ministries which have ensured that much of this will be done without a strain on the budget and in a way that will benefit the economy', 'our social programme will be aimed at accelerating implementation and consolidation of what has been achieved within the limits of our resources', 'this includes   ensuring that  of mothers and young children have access to free medical care  starting the child support grant system which will reach million children by the fifth year  achieving an  cure rate for tuberculosis  implementing the new laws to make drugs and doctors accessible  and in addition to the building of clinics dedicating r million to the upgrading of hospitals', ' in this the year of science and technology our programmes to improve the learning environment including the setting up of the council on higher education will be enhanced by a campaign to usher in a new and dynamic culture of scientific and technical innovation rooted in our schools communities and enterprises', ' in the next financial year a further thousand telephones will be installed', 'and we aim to supply a further million citizens with clean and accessible water', 'at the same time it is our responsibility as the water bill is finalised to change our own water consumption culture recognising that this is a scarce resource that must not be squandered', 'as cabinet finalises these and other plans in the context of multiyear budgeting we shall as always be guided by our concern for the poor and most vulnerable sectors of society  to provide basic services to improve the economy and jobcreation to deepen democracy and good governance and to improve the safety and security of all', 'i should also announce that as a proactive measure to further improve good governance and in accordance with the constitution the presidents office will this year start drafting legislation on ethics in government including a statutory code of conduct applying to members of the executive at national and provincial levels', 'honourable members and delegates   in our efforts we draw inspiration from countries that have to address problems to varying degrees similar to ours', 'in our relationship with the world we can now confidently say that south africa has found her niche as an independent participant in world affairs', 'our starting point in these relations is the obvious that south africa is an african country', 'thus we draw pride from the fact of increased trade with africa reflected in a  increase in exports and  in imports since ', 'we shall continue to expand these relations and close cooperation with our sister african nations bilaterally and through the oau within the context of africas renaissance', 'we are grateful that african nations have afforded us the opportunity to make our humble contribution to the resolution of problems and reconstruction in places like the now democratic republic of congo the great lakes region and the sudan', 'during the course of this year we shall host africa telecom to work out strategies and plans for the continent to become part of the communications highway', 'within sadc we were honoured to take collective leadership of the process towards a free trade area', 'the matters to be resolved on this course are complex and as to be expected there is much individual selfinterest', 'but the will and determination are there including the difficult question of ensuring that the democratic gains that have been made over the past few years are not reversed', 'as an active and respected part of the developing world we shall in august host the summit of leaders of the nonaligned movement', 'as such we shall be afforded the opportunity to play a leadership role as these countries in their own terms define the nature and direction of globalisation', 'all of us in these countries are concerned about the widening gap between the rich and the poor both within and among nations', 'but we also recognise the challenge to ensure that our own cooperation helps to define the new world order', 'as a country we are making strides in this direction as shown by the fact that today asia is our second largest trading partner after europe  and we are starting to exploit the huge potential that exists with regard to latin america', 'this year we started a strategic relationship with the peoples republic of china the biggest nation on earth', 'the launch last year of the indian ocean rim association is a great step that will reestablish in the new age strong relations that date back to precolonial days', 'at the same time we have intensified dialogue with the north about a common human agenda as we enter the millennium', 'in such dialogue pertinent questions about the structure of the united nations and its agencies as well as the issues of the international financial system the debt crisis and world trade are on the agenda', 'there is world consensus that solutions need to be found to the causes and rampant effects of stock market crashes that can beggar even those economies which have got their fundamentals in place', 'it is encouraging that the commonwealth of nations a bodystraddling the northsouth divide and whose summit we attended last year put high on the agenda the issue of economic development', 'again as a reflection of the place we occupy in international relations this body decided to hold its  summit in south africa', 'our relations with north american countries europe and japan have grown from strength to strength', 'we value these relations with our main trading partners and sources of investment and aid', 'more particularly we have now reached the point at which negotiations with the european union on free trade should soon reach finality', 'we shall continue to make our humble contribution to the search for peace and the humane conduct of international relations', 'our condition on these issues including the campaign for a ban on antipersonnel landmines and nuclear disarmament derives from our own experience about what humanity should not do to itself', 'ahead of any other country south africa destroyed its stockpile of over  thousand landmines in a record of  months', 'the severed limbs of children women and men in our neighbouring countries are a loud warning to us that never again should our country be a source of destabilisation', 'as such we shall support the stern action taken by countries whose peace is disturbed by any south africans', 'we are driven by this desire for peace when we urge for the resumption of middle east peace talks on the basis of the oslo agreements', 'we are driven by what we believe are the longterm interests of the palestinian and jewish communities when we condemn prevarication and provocation by those who calculate that they can use might to prevent right', 'we condemn without equivocation violence by any party for it feeds animosity rather than encourages reconciliation', 'in the same spirit we call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in western sahara and east timor and we shall do our best to assist where we can', 'madame speaker   wherever we go internationally we are always moved by the appreciation of the world for our efforts in resolving problems that seemed intractable', 'these international forces are always willing to assist in our exciting transition', 'but they recognise that in the final analysis our success will depend on our own efforts', 'they appreciate and have confidence in our economic environment and equally they expect the same among south africans themselves', 'they respect our nation because they know we are contributing to the collective efforts of humankind redefining itself and reclaiming its humanity as we move into the new millennium', 'this our programme for  is a humble contribution to the quest for a better world', 'as always we are encouraged first and foremost by the fact that south africans are ready  and they have rolled up their sleeves to build a society that cares', 'these millions of south africans are joining hands to sustain their democratic achievement  and they will protect it like the apple of their eye', 'they are filled with hope about the bright future that beckons', 'they shall not be distracted by the noise of a falling tree amidst the dignified silence of a new future starting to blossom  because they know that  the foundation has been laid  and the building has begun']"

us today', 'nelson mandela delivered our first state of the nation address before the first democratically elected parliament on the th of may ', 'in that address he quoted from a poem by ingrid jonker', 'in that poem ingrid jonker said  the child is present at all assemblies and lawgiving the child peers through the windows of houses and into the hearts of mothers this child who only wanted to play in the sun at nyanga is everywhere  the child grown to a man treks on through all africa the child grown to a giant journeys over the whole world without a pass  nelson mandela then went on to say  and in this glorious vision she instructs that our endeavours must be about the liberation of the woman the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child', 'it is these things that we must achieve to give meaning to our presence in this chamber and to give purpose to our occupancy of the seat of government', 'and so we must constrained by and yet regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical burdens seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny', 'the government i have the honour to lead and i dare say the masses who elected us to serve in this role are inspired by the single vision of creating a peoplecentred society', 'accordingly the purpose that will drive this government shall be the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment the continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom', 'the acid test of the legitimacy of the programmes we elaborate the government institutions we create the legislation we adopt must be whether they serve these objectives', '  today we begin the last session of our second democratic parliament', 'we begin this session twoandhalf months before we celebrate our first decade of liberation and democracy', 'we also meet in these houses of parliament not long before we hold our third general elections', 'it is therefore natural that our national legislature should spend some time reflecting on what we have achieved and not achieved during the last ten years', 'inevitably all of us will also make speeches aimed at improving our fortunes in the forthcoming elections', 'but perhaps the correct starting point for the government would be to recall what was said as we began our journey into our democratic future', 'it was for this reason that i quoted what president mandela said at the start of the first session of the first democratic parliament', 'to repeat what he said  the government i have the honour to lead and i dare say the masses who elected us to serve in this role are inspired by the single vision of creating a peoplecentred society', 'accordingly the purpose that will drive this government shall be the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment the continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom', 'the acid test of the legitimacy of the programmes we elaborate the government institutions we create the legislation we adopt must be whether they serve these objectives', '  sometimes it is difficult fully to understand the fact that we are barely ten years away from a time in the lives of our people when our collective future was very uncertain', 'some among us will hardly remember that even as we met in this house to listen to president mandela deliver the state of the nation address fellow south africans were continuing to die as a result of political violence', 'for instance the south africa yearbook  reported that although political violence declined during and after the april  election extensive criminal and political violence continued to persist in the country especially in kwazulunatal and on the east rand of the gauteng province', ' daily fatalities from political violence still numbered six in may and just under four in june', 'others among us will have forgotten that as we sat here listening to that first state of the nation address the commitment made by president mandela to ensure the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment was to many little more than a promise they appreciated but could not fully comprehend', 'the question had still to be answered as to where the resources would be found to finance the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment of which president mandela spoke', 'in the decade up to the middle of  the average annual gdp growth rate was less than  per cent', 'during the first half of  the annualised growth rate stood at  per cent', 'for the fiscal year  the budget deficit stood at ', ' per cent', 'consumer price inflation in the  months up to april  was  per cent', 'by the end of that year the interest rate stood at  per cent', 'on th of february  the then governor of the reserve bank chris stals said a more restrictive monetary policy is needed to make sure that the current economic upswing will not be of the boombust nature of earlier times but will be more durable', '  on the th of june of the same year mr stals sounded an ominous note when he said underlying inflationary pressures are undoubtedly increasing again in the south african economy', 'if left unchecked this trend will eventually force the abortion of the welcome improvement over the past year in real economic growth and will frustrate the objectives of the reconstruction and development programme', '  on the th of august  chris stals said basically the south african economy is not competitive enough to enable it to maintain an economic growth rate at a level high enough for its own needs', 'more drastic economic restructuring will be needed to lift the growth potential of the economy to the desired and more acceptable level', '  in the same speech he expressed the uncertainties of the day when he said economic growth will in the final situation be dependent not only on an improvement in the economic structure of the country but even more so on political and social stability', 'in the final situation all business decisions are influenced by the overall environment in which they are taken', '  on the th of october  he said that the country was still faced with some political uncertainties which impacted on our economic prospects', 'he said  at this stage', 'the country still has to face  the first fully democratic election for local authorities scheduled to take place in early november this year  a more clear definition of the political economic and financial relationships between the central government and regional governments  and the drafting of a final constitution to replace the current interim constitution before the next general election can take place', ' since time immemorial the overwhelming majority of our people had known nothing but despair', 'they knew this as an incontestable matter of fact that tomorrow would not be better than yesterday  it was also fixed and given that the following day would be worse', 'but then april   came and things changed radically and irrevocably for all south africans', 'for the black and especially african majority suddenly a new dawn broke', 'after these masses had cast their votes they still had nothing in their stomachs and their pockets', 'they walked away from the polling booths to return to their miserable shacks their children made listless by hunger and the brutish thugs who prowled the unlit dirt roads of the shantytown ready to pounce on their victims with no sense of mercy', 'they walked the long distances to return to their homesteads of rural squalor to the mornings of the drudgery of women with buckets full of dirty river water on their heads to the daily diet of mealiepap to the dark still and menacing nights broken only by the weak flickering light of the paraffin lamp and the dying embers of an exhausted fire on the humble hearth', 'but yet they had a spring in their step because they knew that a new dawn had proclaimed the coming of a bright day', 'though their hands carried the emptiness to which generations of deprivation had accustomed them their hearts and minds were fired up by a newfound sense of hope and the attendant feeling of dread lest that hope turned out to be but a mere mirage the false creation of a wish that was intensely felt', 'the experience of many decades had taught us to understand that the black poor of our country valued a just peace as deeply as they valued their lives', 'it had taught us that their sense of pride in themselves as human beings made it impossible for them to join in a mass slaughter of other human beings even to satisfy the base instincts of vengeance and retaliating to settle scores', 'over many decades we had seen that these masses would always refuse to turn racist simply because they were subjected to cruel racist rule', 'when a hero in their midst chris hani was murdered in cold blood they refused to fulfil the prophesy of the poet that the blooddimmed tide would be loosed to drown the ceremony of innocence', 'they stood in the voting lines side by side with those who had been their oppressors and never uttered a single word of anger nor jostled their white person next to them because they felt that their time to become the new masters had come', 'black and white stood together acting voluntarily together for the first time in our history together to give birth to a new social order that would serve the interests of all our people', 'when the leadership of these black masses said to them that despite the fact that their children their brothers and sisters their mothers and fathers had been slaughtered in boipatong and elsewhere on the many killing fields in our country they as leaders were obliged to pursue the peaceful advance to a just peace these masses agreed and urged that the dialogue chamber should bring to the nation the gift of a just peace', 'they thought and acted as they did because they knew better than those who had been certified as learned that it was only a just peace that would end their despair and bring into their lives the sense of hope that would make it possible for them to bear the pain of hunger until the day came when they would no longer go hungry', 'it was for these reasons that they had fought ready to sacrifice their lives for the just peace and the sense of hope they saw as the necessary condition for their survival as human beings', 'those among us who are fond of threatening violence to promote their causes should learn to know this that the masses of our people are ready and willing to sacrifice once again to defend the peace and keep alive the sense of hope that enables them to behave in mysteriously miraculous ways', 'i must presume that many of us read the moving article by rian malan published last sunday', 'he says  on this day  years ago i was hiding gold coins under floorboards and trying to get my hands on a gun before the balloon went up', 'as a white south african i was fully expecting war as rightwing boers and bantustan chiefs conspired to annihilate nelson mandelas people and the anc leader squabbled with president fw de klerk over who deserved more credit for their shared nobel peace prize', 'in my view peace would never come', 'there was too much history too much pain and anger', 'ten days before the predicted apocalypse there came a miraculous reprieve', 'a reverent quiet settled upon the nation and the election passed off entirely peacefully', 'i set out to discredit the outcome', 'the peace is illusory i sneered  anarchy is still coming', 'look at crime rape guns and mayhem decaying cities abandoned factories incompetence and corruption everywhere when our new rulers dismissed such criticism as racist i said fine if thats the price one pays for speaking the truth i will consider myself honoured and continue', 'hospitals dont work anymore surly nurses drunken teachers a civil service where the phones just ring  he ends his personal testimony with these words  it is infinitely worse to receive than to give especially if one is arrogant and the gift is something big like mercy or forgiveness', 'the gift of  was so huge that i choked on it and couldnt say thank you', 'but i am not too proud to say it now', '  i have borrowed these honest words from rian malan to tell the painful story that strangely but not surprisingly because of april   our freedom day despair had changed its domicile', 'now because freedom for all our people had become the defining feature of our reality those who had rejoiced in the supremacy of their race opened their doors to despair', 'those who had had despair imposed upon them rejoiced in the triumph of the angel of hope that brought a new life of a shared neighbourhood to all our people no longer fractured by high fortified walls of hatred fear and mistrust', 'but this too the transference of the burden of despair became part of the reality that the new democratic order had to address', 'it became part of what had to be done to achieve what president mandela foretold when he spoke from this podium about the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment and the continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom', 'almost ten years after its liberation from white minority rule our country still faces many challenges', 'many of our people are unemployed', 'many of our people continue to live in poverty', 'violence against the person in all its forms continues to plague especially those sections of our population that are poor and live in socially depressed communities', 'the burden of disease impacting on our people including aids continues to be a matter of serious concern as do issues that relate to the fact that many of our people including the youth lack the education and skills that our economy and society needs', 'there are still many of our people who live in shacks and others who have no access to clean water proper sanitation and electricity', 'imbalances and inequalities that impact on fellow citizens on the basis of race gender and geographic dispersal continue to persist', 'in the  state of the nation address to which we have referred president mandela said we have learnt the lesson that our blemishes speak of what all humanity should not do', ' the point we have sought to make in the last few minutes in referring to the challenges we continue to face is that the blemishes of which madiba spoke continue to disfigure our society', 'we have not as yet eradicated the cruel legacy we inherited that he characterised as the blemishes that all humanity should avoid', 'however despite this reality the answer we have given and will continue to give to the question whether we have made progress with regard to the fundamental tasks of which nelson mandela spoke on the th of may  is a resounding  yes  together with all other objective observers of social development we have always known that our countrys blemishes produced by more than three centuries of colonialism and apartheid could not be removed in one decade', 'nevertheless we have no hesitation in saying that we have made great advances to ensure the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment and the continuous extension of the frontiers of the freedom of which nelson mandela spoke almost ten years ago', 'the statistics and concrete information of which the honourable members the distinguished guests and our country are familiar tell the real story of what we have done and had to do to create the peoplecentred society that has been central to the work of both our first and second democratic governments', 'this real story is that before   estimates of the housing backlog ranged from  million to  million units and people living in shacks were between  million to  million   of the population of south africa had no access to electricity   million people had no access to clean water   million people did not have access to adequate sanitation  there were  fragmented departments of education with a disproportionate allocation of resources to white schools  there was  secondary school enrolment', 'a decade later  about  million housing subsidies have been provided and  million houses built for the poor of our country  more than  households have been electrified   million additional people now have access to clean water   of households now have access to sanitation  there has been a successful formation of an integrated education system even though there is a clear need for more resource allocation and capacity building in poor areas  nutrition and early childhood interventions have been established to improve better results for children from poor backgrounds  by  secondary school enrolment had reached ', 'again the real story of our country tells us that  years ago  south africa was in its twentyfirst year of doubledigit inflation  the country had had three years of negative growth  the economy and the wealth of the nation was shrinking  south africa had experienced more than a decade of declining growth per capita  the average income of south africans had been falling since the s and the overall wealth of the country declined by nearly onethird  from  to the middle of  total net capital outflow from our country amounted to almost r billion', 'government had run up a budget deficit equal to  of the gdp including the debt of the socalled independent homelands  the net open forward position of the south african reserve bank was  billion in deficit  public sector debt was equal to  of the gdp', 'it is this unhealthy economic situation that led chris stals to make the observations to which we have referred', 'a decade later  inflation is down to four percent if you use the cpix or less than one percent if you use the cpi index  the country is experiencing the longest period of consistent positive growth since the gdp was properly recorded in the s  the net open forward position of the south african reserve bank rose to  billion in surplus by the end of last year  public sector debt has come down to less than  of gdp', 'since  we have engaged our people in the various provinces in the process of izimbizo the th and latest being kwazulunatal', 'by this means we have sought to deepen the interaction between the national government and the masses of our people', 'the national ministers provincial and local governments have also carried out their own imbizo campaigns for the same reason', 'we have just presented some of the statistics that tell part of the story of our progress during our first decade of freedom towards the creation of a peoplecentred society', 'the imbizo process has given us an excellent opportunity to hear directly from the people what these figures mean to them', 'it has been truly inspiring to hear directly from the people as they expressed their concerns communicated their aspirations and made suggestions of what needs to be done to take us further forward to meet the needs of the people', 'these masses essentially but not exclusively the poor of our country invariably speak well of the improvements to the quality of their lives that have occurred during the last ten years', 'they talk about the increased access to better housing water electricity roads land school meals and social grants', 'but these masses are equally insistent about the need for all of us to act together to address the outstanding challenges', 'regularly they raise the issue of the need for jobs and the need to provide appropriate training especially for the youth to ensure that on completing their school years they are able to find employment', 'like others of our rural communities rural kwazulunatal called on the government to help with the provision of tractors and seed to assist the people to till the soil', 'the people have not hesitated to make frank and critical assessments especially of the quality of service delivery in their localities as well as the performance of the municipal councillors', 'they also boldly raise other questions such as crime health matters and instances of perceived or actual corruption and malpractice', 'on thursday last week we were at msinga in kwazulunatal', 'one of the participants at the imbizo complained that though people had cellular phones in this rural and mountainous area they could not use them', 'he explained that this was because the cellular phone companies had not erected the necessary masts', 'the staff of the presidents office immediately contacted vodacom and informed them of the complaint made at the imbizo', 'i am very pleased to say that two days ago one of the local leaders at msinga called to say that the service providers had come to the area within hours to attend to the complaint', 'in less than a week the people of msinga had been given the possibility to communicate among themselves and with the rest of the country and the world by telephone', 'we held our last imbizo in kwazulunatal at gamalakhe near harding in the ugu district municipality', 'at this imbizo a local resident drew our attention to instances of corruption in our prisons', 'he then gave us details of his experience of this corruption', 'we have passed these details to judge thabane jali who heads the judicial commission investigating malpractices in our correctional system and who i understand is also present in the chamber', 'again i am pleased to say that within days of receiving this information judge jali has already instructed people assisting him in kwazulunatal to meet the complainant and follow up on his allegations', 'i mention these two instances because they demonstrate both the positive response by the public and private sectors to the call we have made for all our people to work together in the spirit of letsema to tackle the common problems facing our country and people and the fact that the government takes the imbizo process very seriously and tries at all times to respond to the issues raised by the people within the context of availability of resources', 'again i mention this because some in our country for reasons best known to themselves seem very keen to criticise the governments response to the iimbizo on false grounds', 'this happened recently when illinformed allegations were made about commitments we made to the people of bekkersdal in gauteng', 'i would like to take this opportunity to thank both vodacom and judge jali and express the hope that others will follow the excellent example they have set for all of us', 'but perhaps more striking than everything we have said so far about the imbizo process has been the palpable sense of confidence among the people in a better future for their country and themselves', 'this goes together with the complete absence of any sense of distance or alienation from the government they elected', 'these masses attend the iimbizo confident of their right to communicate directly with their government and certain that the process presents them with a genuine opportunity to have their concerns addressed', 'i have listened to our people boldly expressing their views even in areas that not so long ago were paralysed by the fear that to speak ones mind was to invite death', 'this has said to me that we have moved forward most significantly towards the realisation of the objective presented by president mandela when he committed us to the continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom', 'most of us present here will remember that not so long ago the government and the state were to the masses of our people public enemy no ', 'then some thought that to advance the demand that the people shall govern was mere rhetoric of politicians hungry for power', 'institutions that were the cause of our despair have today become repositories of hope', 'when we presented the state of the nation address to our second democratic parliament on june   we spoke of the enormity of the challenge we face to succeed in creating the caring society we have spoken of', '  we said that for this reason this is not a task that can be carried out by the government alone', 'the challenge of the reconstruction and development of our society into one which guarantees human dignity faces the entirety of our people', 'it is a national task that calls for the mobilisation of the whole nation into united peoples action into a partnership with government for progressive change and a better life for all for a common effort to build a winning nation', 'the government therefore commits itself to work in a close partnership with all our people inspired by the call  faranani to ensure that we draw on the energy and genius of the nation to give birth to something that will surely be new good and beautiful', '  the masses of our people individuals and institutions among whom today we cited judge thabane jali and vodacom are responding magnificently to the call we repeat today and will repeat in future  faranani  in a few months time we will return to these chambers to inaugurate our third democratic parliament', 'whoever will be president then will deliver yet another state of the nation address', 'that will provide an opportunity to address the more detailed issues on the governments programme as well as matters that will be covered in the budget speech and the medium term revenue and expenditure perspectives that will support the governments actions as our country begins its second decade of democracy', 'today we present the longerterm perspective for the continued transformation of our country that will and must be based on our countrys achievements during its first decade of liberation', 'in this regard we would like to restate this matter unequivocally that the policies we required to translate what president mandela said in may  are firmly in place', 'accordingly we do not foresee that there will be any need for new and major policy initiatives', 'the task we will all face during the decade ahead will be to ensure the vigorous implementation of these policies to create the winning peoplecentred society of which nelson mandela spoke', 'if i may say this creating that winning nation must include greatly improved organisation management and performance by all the national teams bafana bafana the springboks the proteas and our athletics teams', 'the work we will do must move our country forward decisively towards the eradication of poverty and underdevelopment in our country', 'we must achieve further and visible advances with regard to the improvement of the quality of life of all our people affecting many critical areas of social existence including health safety and security moral regeneration social cohesion opening the doors of culture and education to all and sport and recreation', 'we will have to score new victories in the struggle to create an egalitarian society successfully addressing the important challenges of persisting racial and gender inequalities the disempowerment of our youth and people with disabilities and proper care for children and the elderly', 'we must ensure that our country and people are properly positioned within the global community of nations fully understanding and responding to the diverse political economic social and technological challenges of the process of globalisation', 'in this regard we will have to persist in the work we are doing towards the regeneration of africa and the construction of a new and more equitable world order', 'the advances we must record demand that we ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities to our people as a critical player in the process of the growth reconstruction and development of our country', 'in particular this will require that we further strengthen our system of local government and ensure that the system of traditional government plays the role ascribed to it in our constitution and legislation', 'we must achieve greater progress with regard to the integration of our system of governance achieving seamless cooperation both within and among all spheres of government', 'at the same time we must further consolidate the practice of creating publicprivate partnerships and building governmentcivil society cooperation to ensure that we utilise our collective capacities to give further impetus to the overall development and transformation of our country', 'with regard to the public sector i would like to take this opportunity to salute and thank especially the cadre of public sector managers and leaders that has emerged over the last decade many of whom are with us in this chamber', 'the work they have done and are doing has placed them at the very forefront of the historic processes that are giving birth to a new society', 'i have no hesitation in saying that they stand tall even among their counterparts elsewhere in the world', 'we will continue to rely on them to lead the state and parastatal machinery as we break new ground towards the creation of a peoplecentred society', 'as we enter our second decade of liberation we must continue to build the sense of national unity united action and the new patriotism that have manifested themselves in our peoples response to the calls  faranani masakhane letsema and vukuzenzele working together in conditions of entrenched democracy respect for human rights peace and stability we must continue to produce the good news that has made our country a place of hope even for other people in the rest of the world', 'we already have the policies and programmes that will enable us to translate all the strategic objectives we have just spoken of into a material factor in achieving the goals of the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment and the continuous extension of the frontiers of the freedom of which nelson mandela spoke a decade ago', 'we have already identified the challenges posed by the second economy which economy constitutes the structural manifestation of poverty underdevelopment and marginalisation in our country', 'we must therefore move vigorously to implement all the programmes on which we have agreed to ensure that we extricate all our people from the social conditions that spell loss of human dignity', 'these include the urban renewal and rural development programmes the expanded public works programme the expansion of microcredit and small enterprises the provision of adult basic education and modern skills and the development of the social and economic infrastructure', 'this will also help us enormously to achieve the goals of nonracism nonsexism balanced urbanrural development and social cohesion', 'at the same time we must continue to focus on the growth development and modernisation of the first economy to generate the resources without which it will not be possible to confront the challenges of the second economy', 'this is going to require further and significant infrastructure investments skills development scientific and technological research development and expansion of the knowledge economy growth and modernisation of the manufacturing and service sectors deeper penetration of the global markets by our products increasing our savings levels black economic empowerment and the further expansion of small and medium enterprises', 'we will have to focus on the implementation of the measures we have identified to ensure that we achieve better value for the money spent on social delivery', 'among other things our successes with regard to both the first and second economies must create the conditions for us to reduce the numbers of our people dependent on social grants', 'this will increase the resources available for social expenditures focused on investing in our people further to empower them to become better activists for reconstruction and development away from trapping large numbers within the paradigm of poverty alleviation', 'we will also have to ensure that the institutions and processes we have established and instituted to give effect to the constitutional and practical requirement for cooperative governance function effectively', 'we must also focus especially on raising skills levels within the public sector and ensure its managerial and technological modernisation driven by a clear understanding of the developmental tasks of our democratic state', 'we must be impatient with those in the public service who see themselves as penpushers and guardians of rubber stamps thieves intent on selfenrichment bureaucrats who think they have a right to ignore the vision of batho pele who come to work as late as possible work as little as possible and knock off as early as possible', 'we have also established institutions and processes to give effect to our shared desire to mobilise all our people voluntarily to act together to achieve the tasks of reconstruction and development', 'quite clearly the sustained calls for all of us to respond to a new patriotism have struck a chord among all our people black and white with the exception of the most selfish and selfcentred among us', 'needless to say the further translation of the vision of faranani into a powerful motive force for progressive change can only be achieved within the context of the democratic popular and open participation of all our people black and white in determining our shared destiny', 'in this regard i notice that the traditional doomsayers are back at their favourite sport of trying to frighten us with scarecrows', 'seemingly these have not achieved the maturity of a rian malan', 'instead they are painting monstrous pictures of impending violence during the forthcoming elections and radical constitutional amendments after the elections by the very people who drafted this constitution', 'the masses of our people sacrificed everything to achieve peace and democracy for all of us', 'these masses will not allow that desperate politicians do desperate things to win or retain power for themselves', 'we are all perfectly aware of the tasks of the african renaissance or should be', 'together we have worked very hard to ensure that we make the necessary progress with the challenges of the regeneration of our continent', 'at the same time we will still have to contribute as much as we can to the common african effort to strengthen such institutions as sadc the african union and nepad and help ensure that they discharge their responsibilities effectively', 'we must do this work driven by the conviction that we will not allow anything to stand in our way towards the building of a peaceful democratic and prosperous africa', 'in this regard i would like to pay tribute to the officers men and women of the south african national defence force who are doing sterling work to help advance the cause of democracy and peace in various parts of our continent', 'the new equipment they are receiving will give them increased capacity to meet this and other obligations', 'other regions of the world including the most developed countries are hard at work to change their neighbourhoods for the better', 'we can only ignore or minimise this task with regard to ourselves at our own peril driven by a lingering sense that we are not an integral part of the african continent', 'this we will no do', 'all major current international developments emphasise the importance of constructing a new world order that is more equitable and responsive to the needs of the poor of the world who constitute the overwhelming majority of humanity', 'the iraq affair the continuing and painful conflict involving israel and palestine the wto failure at cancun the seeming paralysis around issues relating to the democratisation of the un and other multilateral institutions the dissonance between the process of globalisation and a multilateral system of governance the issue of global terrorism  all these matters underline the importance of moving forward significantly towards the building of the new world order that has been spoken of for a long time already', 'we must stand ready to play our part in addressing this urgent challenge in our own interest', 'during our second decade of liberation we will ensure that freedom park is built and completed together with other legacy projects that celebrate our humanity our commitment to the allround emancipation of all human beings and human dignity', 'a decade ago nelson mandela said the acid test of the legitimacy of the programmes we elaborate the government institutions we create the legislation we adopt must be whether', ' they help to create a peoplecentred society the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment and the continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom', 'as we progress to the celebration of our first decade of liberation and democracy i trust that the national provincial and local legislatures will give themselves the opportunity to answer the question whether they have passed this acid test', 'what i will say is that during this first decade we have made great progress towards the achievement of the goals we enunciated as we took the first steps as a newborn child', 'we also laid a strong foundation to score even greater advances during the exciting and challenging second decade ahead of us as a people united to build a better south africa and a better world', 'when he contemplated the advent of the end of the th century and the beginning of the st the chilean poet pablo neruda wrote  the eras beginning are these ruined shacks these poor schools these people still in rags and tatters this cloddish insecurity of my poor families is all this the day', 'the centurys beginning the golden door  the men', 'we have it within our power to build our own golden door into our second decade of liberation', 'we have demonstrated that we have the will to answer the question in the affirmative and say  yes this is the day  thank you']"

tambo and the peoples hero chris hani', 'to sis limpho hani and mme adelaide tambo  who need no introduction in this house  and members of their families with us today we wish to say that the memory of these heroes will continue to inspire all of us as we enter the second decade of freedom', 'i am also privileged to recognise eight veterans who are with us here today the first time in their lives

calendar once more we say welcome to the outstanding sportsmen who have gathered in our country in zimbabwe and kenya to test one another in a peaceful contest of human skill ingenuity and endurance',

africa will launch its bid to host the  soccer world cup', 'government wishes to assure our soccer world cup bid committee of our fullest support as they go into the bidding process', 'we are certain

the world are also focussed on another place this time on the western shores of the atlantic ocean the great city of new york which hosts the parliament of the world the united nations organisation', 'today the inspectors charged with the responsibility to ensure that iraq rids itself of weapons of mass destruction will report to the united nations security council about whether or not they are succeeding in their task', 'their report may very well decide the question whether the peoples of the world will continue to enjoy a global peace', 'this we must say that for us as africans to host the cricket world cup like the presidents golf cup later this year communicates the message that we were not wrong when we said that this the st century will be an african century', 'however for us to realise this objective we require that unlike the th the st century should be a century of african peace', 'it should also be a century of world peace', 'hopefully todays report of the united nations weapons inspectors to the united nations security council will not serve as a signal to some that the time has come to unleash the fury of war', 'today on the th of february two great world cities new york and cape town have to grapple with the fundamental human question of war and peace', 'they have to choose sides in the contest between human hope and human despair between war and peace', 'as we speak a number of our citizens are preparing to travel to iraq', 'these are the experts who led our countrys programme to destroy our nuclear chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction as well as the missiles for the delivery of these weapons in conditions of combat', 'the work they did has now resulted in the south african example of disarmament being recognised internationally as an example of best international practice', 'recently we proposed to the government of iraq and the secretarygeneral of the united nations mr kofi annan that this team should visit iraq to share with the government scientists engineers technicians and people of iraq our experience relevant to the mission of the united nations and iraq to eradicate weapons of mass destruction under international supervision', 'i am pleased to inform the honourable members that iraq has accepted our offer which we have already discussed with the leadership of the weapons inspectors', 'we trust that this intervention will help to ensure the necessary proper cooperation between the united nations inspectors and iraq so that the issue of weapons of mass destruction is addressed satisfactorily without resort to war', 'i would also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the government of iraq for its positive response to our suggestion as well as the recent decisions it has taken to allow the u and other aerial surveillance flights to encourage its citizens to be interviewed at any location decided by the inspectors without any iraqi officials present and to adopt legislation prohibiting the production of weapons of mass destruction', 'to assist with regard to this last matter we have given iraq copies of our own legislation dealing with weapons of mass destruction the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction act of  as well as notices and regulations published in terms of the act in the period between  and ', 'we have done all this because we prefer peace to war', 'we have taken the positions we have not to oppose or support any country nor to seek any glory', 'we have done what we have because as south africans and africans we know the pain of war and the immeasurable value of peace', 'during the last century south africans lost their lives in the titanic battles of the first and second world wars and the korean war', 'many paid the supreme sacrifice in a protracted contest within our country and a dishonourable confrontation with the peoples of the rest of africa especially southern africa as we struggled to end the system of apartheid', 'at that time some among us worked to develop and accumulate exactly the terrible weapons that the security council is demanding that iraq should destroy', 'as we meet here for the first time this year we trust that this democratically elected forum of the people of south africa will pronounce itself unequivocally in favour of peace against war', 'we urge that our national parliament

give peace a chance', 'i am convinced that this representative body of the masses of our people will do what it can to contribute to the international effort to ensure that our country our continent and the rest of the world avoid an immensely destructive war', 'we speak in favour of peace because our people prefer peace to war', 'they yearn for peace because they know from their experience that without peace there can be no development', 'without development we will not be able to realise the goal of a better life for all', 'without peace we will fail in the effort in which we are engaged to transform ours into a country of hope and revert to the past on which we have turned our backs a past of misery and despair', 'madame speaker  with regard both to changing the lives of south africans

goals for which so many of our people sacrificed', 'this is the perspective that will inform our work as we strive to meet our obligations to our people and the peoples of africa and the world', 'last year when we spoke from this podium we said our country has a continuing task to push back the frontiers of poverty and expand access to a better life for all', 'the challenge we all face as south africans is to put our shoulders to the wheel to accelerate the pace of change', 'to address this goal we called on our people to offer their time and skills to the nation as letsema volunteers for reconstruction and development', 'we also urged the nation to follow the example set by some of our nationals resident in the united states who had decided to support the development of the country of their birth', 'as they engaged this task they adopted the call  vukuzenzele  madame speaker  i would like to take this opportunity to extend a word of thanks and appreciation to the thousands of our people who rolled up their sleeves to lend a hand in the national effort to build a better life for all south africans', 'this includes some of the honourable members of parliament present here today', 'their involvement in practical work to improve the conditions of the people  be it in the campaign to register people for social grants assistance at police stations izimbizo or improvement of learning teaching and discipline in our schools  emphasises the partnership that should exist between the various arms of government to ensure that life changes for the better especially among the poor', 'it underlines the importance of the contact we must maintain continuously with the people of our country who elected us', 'of course our thanks also go to the ordinary citizen letsema volunteers some of whom participated in the spectacular opening ceremony of the cricket world cup as they had done when we hosted the launch of the african union and hosted the world summit for sustainable development', 'in addition these ordinary citizen volunteers had participated in all the initiatives undertaken throughout the year', 'as we continue to respond to the challenge to put our shoulders to the wheel to accelerate the pace of change we reiterate the appeal to all our people to sustain the volunteer letsema campaign and respond to the call  vukuzenzele  madame speaker  honourable members will remember that in our address to the house last year we expressed the confidence of government in the health of our economy', 'we asserted then that despite the difficulties that we may experience from time to time and despite the economic downturn across the globe our economy was robust and had the potential to perform relatively well', 'indeed the country has managed to stay the course of growth with the growth of the gross domestic product for  estimated at ', 'gross fixed capital formation grew by almost  during the year', 'we have now had  consecutive years of positive growth', 'manufacturing grew by  in  the fastest growth since ', 'our currency has wrested back the losses it suffered during ', 'during  it recorded its first annual gain against the us dollar in  years', 'in the first three quarters of  household consumption expenditure grew by an average of  while disposable income increased by over ', 'household debt as a percentage of disposable income is at its lowest level since ', 'in the third quarter of  gross savings as a percentage of gdp increased above  for the first time since ', 'through tax reform we have since  cumulatively increased the income of citizens by a total of r billion', 'at the same time the introduction of minimum wages for domestic and farm workers should help improve the income of the most vulnerable workers', 'this process will continue in a few other sectors in consultation with the relevant roleplayers', 'we also pride ourselves on the contribution that the government has made directly to the income of citizens', 'through two increases in social grants announced in april and october last year a total of r billion was made available to the most vulnerable in our society', 'this will be augmented by further increases this year', 'over the last decade including the period when we had to correct the macroeconomic imbalances expenditure on social services grew by  per cent per year in real terms', 'government has put in place various measures to deal with the emergency arising from high food prices', 'in addition to mediumterm measures that include the setting up of the food monitoring committee government made r million available for food parcels and agricultural starterpacks as well as other resources for food relief in southern africa', 'these direct contributions to the income of citizens especially the poor serve to complement the social wage that has improved with each passing year', 'this social wage includes the increased number of water and electricity connections the patent improvements in teaching and learning in our schools the acceleration of the land restitution and redistribution programme which includes hundreds of thousands of title deeds in urban areas primary health care and free housing', 'it complements the efforts of government to contribute to economic growth to expand and modernise the economic infrastructure and the substantial resources allocated to the development of small medium and microenterprises', 'madame speaker  over the past few years we have worked hard to lay the basis for the advances we must make to meet the goal of a better life for all', 'at the centre of this are the related objectives of the eradication of poverty and the fundamental transformation of our country into one that is nonracial nonsexist and prosperous', 'we have no doubt that our policies have been and are a correct response to the practical reality we inherited', 'the changes taking place in our country attest to this', 'the lives of our people are changing for the better', 'gradually we are moving away from the entrenched racial gender and spatial rigidities of the past', 'our economy is demonstrating a resilience and dynamism that is the envy of many across the world', 'truly the tide has turned', 'despite resistance among some our people are developing a strong sense of a common patriotism', 'our country occupies an honoured place among the nations of the world as part of the global forces working for the progressive transformation of our common universe', 'none of this happened of its own', 'it is the outcome of the elaboration and implementation of correct policies since ', 'because of all this let us again affirm that with regard both to changing the lives of south africans for the better and building relations of human solidarity with the peoples of the world the tide has turned', 'our task is to take this tide at the flood further to progress towards the achievement of the goals for which so many of our people sacrificed', 'this is the perspective that will inform our work as we strive to meet our obligations to our people and the peoples of africa and the world', 'in this regard we must pay the closest attention to issues of implementation and as practical an approach as possible to the work we all face as south africans', 'building on the foundations we have laid down we must once more set ourselves the necessary realistic tasks for the year', 'needless to say these must be located within the broad perspective we have just indicated', 'these tasks encompass such areas as   expanded service provision   improvements in the efficiency of the public service   increased social and economic investment   black economic empowerment   greater allround attention to the challenge of human resource development to help reduce the unemployment levels   further improvements within the criminal justice system   further work on the important matter of moral renewal   expanding our system of relations with the rest of the world   accelerating the process of the formulation and implementation of the first nepad projects  and  advancing the african union agenda including the important issue of peace and security', 'with regard to the foregoing madame speaker we would like to emphasise that this programme is informed by the experience we continue to gain in implementing practical projects  by the interaction through iimbizo and other means with the people who more than any consultants know what their needs are and how these needs can best be met  and by the continuing research that we are conducting to collate and distil the experience of the first decade of freedom', 'i wish to assure the thousands of south africans who attended these izimbizo with ministers premiers mecs and councillors that we have listened  we have heard  and we have better understood what the people want', 'for instance having listened to the people of bekkersdal during the presidential imbizo in gauteng national government will work with both the province and local government to introduce public works programmes in this area', 'we shall find safe and secure land for settlement and upgrade community infrastructure both to improve social services and to provide some employment', 'as the honourable members and the country are aware we have for some years implemented gear among other things to generate the resources for us to address the social needs of our people', 'as a result of our successes in this regard this year will see a further expansion of services to the people', 'this will cover a number of areas including old age and disability pensions the child support grant which will be extended progressively to cover children up to the age of  the school feeding scheme food and nutrition education health water and electricity', 'as we are extending unemployment insurance to workers that have previously been excluded such as domestic seasonal and agricultural workers we urge all employers to ensure that their workers are properly registered', 'our specific objective with regard to all these interventions is to reach as many of the most vulnerable as possible', 'to ensure an integrated approach to this matter of the further expansion of services to the people this year we will complete our work on a comprehensive social security system as well as the social health insurance scheme', 'some of the measures we will take in the context of our expanded service delivery include provision of free health care to persons with disabilities reaching the  of those who are eligible for a supply of free basic water who still have no access to this service providing poor households in areas connected to the grid with up to kw of free basic electricity', 'in nongrid areas such households will be provided with a subsidy of up to  of the market cost to provide access to electricity systems', 'we will pay similar attention to a comprehensive response to the health challenges facing our country', 'this must include responses to the fundamental problem of poverty eradication and better nutrition lifestyles observance of legal and social norms with regard to road safety the social fabric within especially those communities living in poverty and the culture of observing treatment regimes with regard to such curable diseases as tuberculosis', 'we will continue the work to eradicate malaria in our country and the other sadc countries by ', 'we will further intensify the efforts to reduce the incidence of the leading killerdisease tb', 'similarly we will continue to focus on the treatment of sexually transmitted infections', 'working together with sanac we will continue to implement the governments comprehensive strategy on hiv and aids relating to all elements of this strategy', 'this includes implementation of the decisions of the constitutional court', 'madame speaker  with regard to the accomplishment of the task of ensuring a better life for all we must make the observation that the government is perfectly conscious of the fact that there are many in our society who are unable to benefit directly from whatever our economy is able to offer', 'obviously this includes those on pension and the very young', 'but it also includes people who are unskilled and those with low levels of education in general', 'this reflects the structural fault in our economy and society as a result of which we have a dual economy and society', 'the one is modern and relatively well developed', 'the other is characterised by underdevelopment and an entrenched crisis of poverty', 'we have to respond to the needs of the fellow south africans trapped in the latter society in a focussed and dedicated manner to extricate them from their condition', 'the expansion in social provision must reach this sector of our society to relieve the poverty and suffering afflicting these masses of our people', 'as we will indicate later other government interventions will also focus on this sector in a particular way', 'critically some of these interventions must aim at ensuring that as many as possible of those who fall within this category move out of the trap within which they are caught', 'accordingly the government must act to ensure that we reduce the number of people dependant on social welfare increasing the numbers that rely for their livelihood on normal participation in the economy', 'this also especially relevant to the accomplishment of the goal of enhancing the dignity of every south african', 'we must also refer to the important matter of gender equality', 'some progress is being made in government to address this issue', 'and in the private sector and civil society the campaign on the rights of women has started at least to form part of the national discourse', 'but society still lags far behind in terms of actual implementation particularly in mainstreaming gender issues on development and povertyeradication', 'within government we will continue to insist on the implementation of the national framework for womens empowerment and gender equality', 'concretely we will soon introduce a system through which gender representation targets and content of programmes become part of the core performance criteria of every government institution and manager', 'the effective delivery of the expanded services to the people requires that we improve the efficiency of the public service', 'without an efficient and effective public service it will be impossible for us to register the advances that we are capable of', 'again this will require that we make a number of determined interventions', 'by the middle of this year the national and provincial governments will complete the process of auditing the public service personnel in these spheres of government and determining their personnel needs in terms of the tasks that confront government', 'this will enable us to effect the necessary adjustments to ensure that the public service has the people with the right skills at the right places in the right numbers', 'to overcome the problems that we have continued to experience in the distribution of social grants with an adverse impact on people in need we shall speed up the process to set up a national social security agency', 'cognisant of the critical role of local government the central and provincial governments will work together to extend assistance to this sphere of our system of governance in particular to improve its managerial technical and administrative capacity', 'the government will create a public service echelon of multiskilled community development workers who will maintain direct contact with the people where these masses live', 'we are determined to ensure that government goes to the people so that we sharply improve the quality of the outcomes of public expenditures intended to raise the standard of living of our people', 'it is wrong that government should oblige the people to come to the government even in circumstances in which the people do not know what services the government offers and have no means to pay for the transport to reach government offices', 'it will be particularly important that we attract the right people into this cadre of community development workers train them properly and supervise them effectively', 'these development workers must truly be inspired by the letter and spirit of batho pele among other things these workers will help to increase the effectiveness of our system of local government strengthening its awareness of and capacity to respond to the needs of the people at the local level', 'to ensure the proper execution of multisector projects we will appoint dedicated project managers accountable to teams of relevant officials and the executive with the authority and responsibility to ensure implementation across departments and spheres of government', 'at the same time monitoring capacity at the level of the presidency will have to be strengthened', 'a framework for this approach will be ready in the next four months', 'the process to set up a governmentwide call centre will be speeded up', 'in addition we will start this year to phase in an electronic system an egovernment gateway in which the directory of government services will be available according to citizens needs rather than the silos of the state bureaucracy an electronic version of the multipurpose community centres', 'as parliament and our people know for two years we have focused on particular rural and urban nodes in the context of the drive to assist the poorest in our country to achieve development and an improved standard of living', 'to improve our work in this regard steps will be taken to ensure proper coordination cooperation and operational integration among the three spheres of government', 'we will this year also finalise the proposal for harmonisation of systems conditions of service and norms between the public service in the national and provincial spheres on the one hand and the municipalities on the other', 'this year we also have to finalise the longrunning debate about the role and place of the institution of traditional leadership bearing in mind that this is one of our constitutional organs of government', 'the necessary national framework legislation will therefore be tabled which will enable the provincial legislatures to approve legislation specific to each of our provinces', 'in cooperation with the provincial government a multidisciplinary national team is working in the eastern cape to contribute to the solution of the problems facing this province', 'this work will continue with the necessary speed and intensity', 'it will also help the government as a whole to understand what needs to be done to improve our overall system of governance', 'in this regard we will pay particular attention to five departments these being finance education social development health and public works', 'all these must have the necessary capacity to do their work properly', 'they must function in a manner that will enable us to meet our national goals', 'the work being done in the eastern cape will also assist us greatly further to intensify our offensive against the cancer of corruption within the public service', 'this work will be intensified in all three spheres of government building on the experience accumulated within departments and through the efforts of such institutions as the public protector the auditorgeneral and the public service commission', 'further improvement in the quality of the lives of our people also requires that we take new measures to increase the volume and quality of our investment in the social infrastructure', 'this includes such areas as housing and municipal infrastructure hospitals and clinics schools roads water electricity and government facilities', 'in all these areas we must improve our performance relative to the previous year', 'accordingly additional resources will be set aside to meet this obligation', 'we will ensure that these resources are actually used consistent with what we have said about the need to ensure that we have the necessary mechanisms to implement our policies and decisions', 'in this regard we must commend the provinces for significantly improved efficiency in the area of capital investment', 'for the period of  months of the current fiscal year expenditure in this area has increased by  per cent compared to the same period during the previous fiscal year', 'at the same time it seems clear that not all the allocated funds will be spent by the end of the financial year', 'it is precisely this shortcoming that we must address this year', 'with regard to this social investment we will pay particular but not exclusive attention to the nodal points already identified in the context of our urban renewal and rural development programmes', 'it is in these areas that we find the largest concentration of the marginalised sections of our population which require dedicated interventions to extricate them from conditions of underdevelopment and entrenched poverty', 'this dictates that we focus on them with regard to our social spending as well as social and economic infrastructure investment', 'to address this investment in social infrastructure the government has decided that we should launch an expanded public works programme', 'this will ensure that we draw significant numbers of the unemployed into productive work and that these workers gain skills while they work and thus take an important step to get out of the pool of those who are marginalised', 'we will also further expand the network of the multipurpose community centres', 'the government will also make various interventions in the economy in general further to encourage its growth and development', 'in this regard we must mention that it is planned that the growth and development summit that we mentioned last year is now scheduled for the beginning of may', 'among others the summit should address issues of higher rates of investment job creation economic restructuring and improved efficiency and productivity and greater social equity', 'all the social partners will have to indicate what they will contribute to the common effort to tackle these various challenges', 'for its part the government has been working on its own contribution some of which is indicated in this state of the nation address', 'we will complete our submission in the near future and make it available to the participants at the growth and development summit', 'we urge our social partners to finalise their own inputs so that the next stage of the preparations for the summit can commence as soon as possible', 'in addition to what we have said the governments economic programme will focus on   continued implementation of our existing microeconomic reform programme   investment in the economic infrastructure and other measures   small and medium business development   microcredit for productive purposes   black economic empowerment  and  job creation', 'the honourable members will remember that three years ago we announced a microeconomic reform programme which took advantage of the achievements we had made in stabilising our macroeconomic environment', 'this included focussed action in specific growth sectors such as agriculture mining tourism cultural industries information technology clothing and textiles vehicle manufacturing and chemicals', 'we will now add to this list the aerospace sector as well as call centres and back office business processing', 'in addition specific programmes will be put in place this year to improve assistance to and expand the pool of exporters', 'these include changes to the export marketing assistance scheme and upgrading our representation in strategic markets abroad', 'the successes in the automobile and components sector also point to the work that needs to be done to use a simplified tariff book as an instrument of industrial policy', 'greater focus will also be paid to the service sector including the expansion of the ict youth internship programme', 'more than r billion has been set aside for capital expenditure in the mtef period including at the national level r billion for infrastructure', 'planned investment by the major state corporations for  is at least r billion', 'this investment will include key economic infrastructure projects such as the construction in the coming period of the john ross highway to richards bay a dam on the olifants river in the limpopo province to provide water for platinum mining and agriculture the construction of ngqura coega port and concessioning of the durban container terminal', 'the improvement of infrastructure at the kwazulunatal coast includes the relocation of durban international airport to la mercy and the establishment of the dube trade port', 'within  months details in this regard should be finalised for the private sector to be invited to take part in the project', 'massive investments will be dedicated to upgrading and acquiring railway rolling stock as well as the taxi recapitalisation programme which after extensive consultations should start this year', 'further work will also be done to improve the infrastructure at our major border posts to facilitate movement of people and goods', 'necessarily this must be accompanied by the appropriate staffing of these transit points to eliminate inefficiencies that derive from undertrained personnel', 'further to reduce the cost of doing business in our country with regard to liquid fuels the government has decided to replace the in bond landed cost pricing mechanism with what is referred to as the basic fuel price formula', 'this new approach which we believe will save fuel users more than r billion a year will be phased in starting in april this year', 'we wish to assure the industry that this process will be handled in a manner that does not adversely affect the sustainability of the industry and elements of black economic empowerment already agreed upon', 'with regard to the restructuring of state assets the honourable members know that we will soon proceed with the listing of telkom', 'work will also go ahead towards the introduction of a second national telecommunications operator', 'we have already mentioned the initiatives affecting the transport sector', 'further work will be done relating to electricity', 'the government will also continue to work on publicprivate partnerships to increase its capacity to respond to the needs of our people', ' of these are already operational in such areas as health education transport housing information technology tourism and government accommodation', 'the development and support for small and medium business and the cooperative sector remains a priority for government', 'accordingly more financial and other resources will be committed to the development of this sector of our economy', 'this will also see increased support for business chambers and business development organisations and the expansion of the business mentorship programme', 'womenowned businesses will receive additional support through the south african women entrepreneurs network sawen which was launched last year', 'similarly we will continue to pay attention to the important area of agricultural development', 'we will table legislation amending the small business act among other things to establish a nationwide advocacy body to act as the voice of this sector and to ensure that support to smmes are available at the local level throughout the country', 'with regard to the rural areas this year we will complete the processing of the communal land bill not only to ensure certainty in the ownership of assets by families in rural areas including women but also to encourage smallscale and cooperative agricultural production and thus improved food security', 'as the bill indicates this will be done in such a way that communal relations and elements of culture consistent with democracy and human rights are not undermined', 'in this context certainly government has no intention to marginalise the traditional system of government', 'the government recognises the importance of the microenterprise sector with regard to the task of poverty alleviation', 'we have therefore established an apex fund to provide microcredit to people at the grassroots level', 'discussions with institutions active in this field will be concluded soon so that the funds set aside reach the people in need as soon as possible', 'despite continuing improvements in the capacity of the economy to create new jobs the issue of unemployment remains one of our major challenges', 'fundamentally the solution to this problem is dependant on our achieving the necessary rates of economic growth and development', 'accordingly everything we have said about the economy also relates directly to the issue of job creation', 'in this context we must raise the critically important matter of human resource development', 'as the honourable members know we launched our human resources development strategy in june ', 'this strategy covers the entire spectrum from early childhood development primary and secondary education technical and vocational training through adult basic education to skills enhancement through the sector education and training authorities onthejob training in the public works programmes and specialised institutions such as the projected advanced institute for information and communication technology', 'as we have already indicated by the middle of the year we should have an accurate picture of the skills profile and skills shortages in the public service', 'progress is also being made in identifying such shortages in the private sector', 'we are doing this work so that we are able to focus our human resource development strategy correctly', 'despite the problems they have experienced the setas have already shown what can be achieved', 'by the end of last year over   learners had or were participating in training programmes ranging from entry level programmes to professional level and postprofessional training across the entire spectrum of occupations and sectors', 'to increase access to these programmes by the unemployed the government will take the lead in bringing more of these into its own training programmes', 'we trust that the private sector will also do the same as part of the common contribution to the objectives of the growth and development summit', 'as we have also indicated we will use the expanded public works programme to provide onthejob training to the workers that will carry out this programme', 'again this will concentrate on the section among our working people that is marginalised by virtue of low educational and skills levels', 'we are convinced that sustained and correctly focused work in the area of human resource development together with the varied economic interventions we have mentioned will help the country in the effort to attend to the important challenge of unemployment', 'in this regard the government will also present to our social partners a framework for an employment strategy to ensure that we create the best possible conditions for a concerted drive to reduce the levels of unemployment', 'as we approach the end of the first decade of our new democracy the need for an economic transformation that brings about effective and significant black economic empowerment becomes more pressing', 'we believe that it is in the interests of all citizens that we succeed in this endeavour', 'through a farsighted partnership between all sectors of our society we can ensure a stable and growing economy that erases the inequities of the past and draws us all  irrespective of our race sex or creed  into a more prosperous and equitable future', 'the government concurs with the view of the black economic empowerment commission that it is now necessary to make our policies on black economic empowerment more explicit', 'in the light of the important developments in industries such as liquid fuels fishing and mining we need to ensure clarity and certainty for all economic actors', 'the government is firmly of the view that economic growth development and black economic empowerment are complementary and related processes', 'the empowerment we speak of is an inclusive process and not an exclusive one', 'no economy can meet its potential if any part of its citizens is not fully integrated into all aspects of that economy', 'equally it follows that an economy that is not growing cannot integrate all its citizens into that economy in a meaningful way', 'the government has prepared a detailed set of proposals on black economic empowerment and the minister of trade and industry and the department of trade and industry on behalf of government have consulted extensively', 'today i will set out the basic framework and approach', 'on budget day the minister of finance will deal with the governments positive financial and macroeconomic assessment of the bee process and shortly thereafter the minister of trade and industry will publish the detailed documents and processes that i will now outline', 'we will introduce into parliament early this year a basic enabling piece of legislation that will establish broad parameters for the policy and allow for the publication of the strategy document and guidelines dealing with good practice in terms of the policy all of which will make up the global transformation charter', 'this approach has been adopted to allow pragmatism and flexibility within the different components of the economy', 'a rigid and inflexible approach is not in the best interests of a modern and globally competitive economy', 'however by passing such an enabling act we wish to signal to all that meaningful economic transformation is fundamental to our collective prosperity', 'as with all acts the bill will be open to comment in the parliamentary process', 'with the publication of the guidelines shortly we intend to establish certainty and stability', 'it is not in the interests of the economy that we have continuously moving goal posts', 'however we also need to ensure that we respond effectively to changing circumstances  as we do with all policy  and to this end we will establish a nonstatutory advisory council', 'empowerment is defined as a broadbased process and the scorecard approach  covering ownership management employment equity skills development procurement corporate social responsibility investment and enterprise formation  developed in the mining charter has been adopted', 'the guidelines will provide more precision as to what can be defined as blackowned enterprises', 'the actions and outcomes that are within bee policy will be spelt out', 'government does not seek to encourage charters for every sector of the economy', 'this is unrealistic and not necessarily useful', 'the basic guideline is that where government disposes of any right licence or partnership arrangement then bee components to the arrangement will be clearly spelt out', 'this is in line with existing practice', 'a charter therefore best serves certain sectors', 'accordingly government is supportive of the work being done in the financial sector', 'if enterprises in a sector feel that they need a charter they should be clear on their objectives and take advice from government', 'the guidelines will set out the basic principles that should be contained in any charter and will make it clear that there needs to be consultation at all times so as to involve stakeholders', 'we would stress however that all enterprises will be encouraged to utilise the guidelines on empowerment and to develop their own scorecard approach', 'certainly in any dealing of significance with the public sector this will be expected of an enterprise', 'the government will lay greatest stress on black economic empowerment that is associated with growth development and enterprise development and not merely redistribution of existing wealth', 'we will work in partnership with the private sector and will further ensure that government actions are coordinated and monitored', 'madame speaker  over the past three years our security agencies have been hard at work implementing the national crime combating strategy targeted at priority crimes and policing areas with the highest incidence of serious crimes', 'we can say with confidence that definite progress is being made in this regard', 'we will continue to improve the capacity of the police service to discharge its crime prevention and combating responsibilities in these priority areas', 'since  the rates of serious crime in targeted areas have either been reduced or stabilised', 'murder has been reduced by almost ', 'case backlogs and the number of awaiting trial prisoners have been reduced as a result of the implementation of saturday courts and improvements in the integrated justice system', 'crimes against women and children have received priority attention including the establishment of more sexual offences courts', ' of these were launched in the past  months alone', 'better intelligence capacity has improved the prevention and combating of crimes such as bank robberies cashintransit heists and hijacking of vehicles', 'before we identify the challenges for the coming year we take this opportunity to thank all the security agencies for the sterling work that they did during the course of last year in securing both the launch of the african union and arguably the biggest international conference ever held the world summit on sustainable development and now the icc cricket world cup', 'i am pleased to convey to the ministers and deputy ministers responsible as well as the leaders and members of these agencies the congratulations of many leaders across the globe for the excellent work they have done to guarantee the security of important visitors to our country', 'last year we were suddenly confronted with terrorist attacks for which a number of people have now been arrested and charged', 'our security forces will continue to work on this challenge', 'at the same time we will do everything possible to get to the bottom of this matter being convinced that no normal south african has any reason to resort to force to communicate his or her views', 'the campaign to reduce the number of illegal firearms and other weapons will continue', 'a considerable proportion of crimes against the person including murder the abuse of women and children assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and common assault take place among the most marginalized sections of our population', 'in many instances these are also connected to alcohol and drug abuse', 'it is therefore necessary that we adopt a multisector approach to deal with these crimes in the poor and underdeveloped areas of our country', 'measures will be taken to ensure that the structures meant to support the security agencies such as the sandf commandos and police reservists are properly regulated to do what they were set up for', 'in this regard in order to ensure security for all in the rural areas including the farmers government will start in the near future to phase out sandf commandos at the same time as we create in their place a new system whose composition and ethos accord with the requirements of all rural communities', 'more attention will be paid to stricter border control', 'this will require among other things improving the capacity of the department of home affairs to carry out its tasks including the implementation of the new immigration legislation', 'critical posts will be filled and the automated home affairs national identification system will be launched', 'it will also be necessary to upgrade the population register and deal with corruption across the board including security at government printers where identity and other documents are produced', 'the programme to deal with case backlogs will continue including increasing the number of saturday and specialised courts', 'in this regard the letsema of legal practitioners from outside of government in this programme is highly appreciated', 'we are pleased that this year the constitutional court will move into its new and permanent home on constitutional hill in johannesburg', 'further improvement in the physical infrastructure required by our judicial system is also represented by the new khayelitsha magistrates court nationally the second biggest after johannesburg which we will open officially later this year', 'taking advantage of the findings of the jali commission we will launch a determined programme to root out the corruption and mismanagement found in sections of our correctional service', 'our success in the sphere of the criminal justice system will also depend on strengthening the partnerships of the letsema campaign with communities volunteering to assist the security agencies in their work', 'again in this area as in all others conditions are ripe for us to forge a peoples contract for a safer and better south africa', 'madame speaker  as honourable members are aware we returned some ten days ago from the extraordinary summit of the african union in addis abba where africa reasserted the wish of the continent for global peace security and development', 'in this context it expressed itself in favour of the peaceful resolution of the question of iraq', 'at this summit the au took specific decisions on proposed amendments to the constitutive act of the union and steps towards the setting up of the commission of the au and the ratification of the protocols on the peace and security council and the african parliament', 'this year marks the th anniversary of the formation of the organisation of african unity', 'this africa day  may  will be an opportunity for south africa to host dignitaries from across the continent as we affirm continuity in the objectives of the african continent and at the same time celebrate the positive changes that the formation of the au will certainly bring', 'i am certain that all our people will celebrate this day with the honour and dignity it deserves', 'a critical part of the positive changes heralded by the formation of the african union is its programme for development nepad', 'considerable progress was made during the course of last year to cement partnerships within africa and further afield so that we can translate nepad without delay into concrete projects that will impact positively on the lives of the people of the continent', 'we are heartened by the fact that africas sense of urgency to start implementing this programme is shared by governments the private sector and civil society on all continents', 'within weeks the nepad implementation committee will finalise criteria standards institutions and legal instruments for the peer review mechanism pending the setting up of relevant institutions within the african union', 'more critically in various regions of the continent work continues to identify and start implementing the projects that will give practical meaning to the beginnings of africas renewal', 'we take this opportunity to congratulate the people of the kingdom of lesotho who last year conducted a peaceful free and fair election', 'we will also continue to work with the people of zimbabwe as they seek solutions to the problems afflicting their country', 'we hope that sooner rather than later these solutions will be found through dialogue among the leaders of this neighbouring country', 'in the kingdom of swaziland we hope that efforts at constitutional reform will soon bear fruit', 'conditions for peace and development are steadily taking shape in the democratic republic of the congo burundi sudan and angola and south africa will always be ready to assist where we can to ensure that the peace prosperity and national reconciliation that these sisterpeoples deserve are achieved', 'we remain firm in our hope that the longdelayed issue of western sahara will be resolved without further delay', 'the international community also has an urgent responsibility to help resolve the issue of the establishment of an independent state of palestine side by side and at peace with the state of israel', 'in a number of african countries south africas sons and daughters serving in our national defence force are working to contribute to peace as a critical condition for development', 'we are proud of their efforts and dip our banners in honour of those who have fallen on duty', 'we will continue this year to strengthen our relations with countries of the south and improve our multifaceted relations with the developed world', 'this will include continued trade negotiations with mercosur china india and the united states', 'our role in international relations is enhanced by our responsibility to take forward decisions of the nonaligned movement and the african union which we chair and to assist the united nations in realising the commitments of the world conference against racism and the world summit on sustainable development which we hosted', 'honourable members  in carrying out these our international responsibilities we proceed from the premise that our success in social change and nationbuilding is conditional on the progress that humanity makes in building a caring world', 'inversely building a new and prosperous nation is itself our own humble contribution to the wellbeing of humanity as a whole', 'in the implementation of our programmes we need to pay particular attention to culture music and the arts as manifestations of our selfimage as a nation', 'this year we will strengthen the partnerships aimed at identifying and nurturing south african talent at affording the creativity of our artists free reign and at giving appropriate promotion of our talents', 'as a contribution to building the selfimage that attaches to a proud nation we shall continue this year with the project to build the first phase of the freedom park monument following on the introduction of new national orders last year and others that will be launched this year', 'we are confident that the best of our architects designers and other creative workers together with others from the rest of africa and other parts of the world will avail their talent for the construction of a freedom park that we hope will stand out as an important tribute to the dignity of africans and all human beings', 'the selfimage that we speak of includes the values that should define us both as a nation and as its individual components', 'it should also find expression in the peoples contract for moral regeneration as we all strive to become a caring society of upstanding citizens', 'the south african peoples contract for a better tomorrow is starting to express itself also in the campaign of citizens across the diverse identities that define us to build pride in our country and promote its attributes abroad', 'the efforts of the international marketing council proudly south african and the many individual initiatives in this regard require our support', 'it is in this spirit that we should engage in a national dialogue on how we take forward the report and recommendations of the truth and reconciliation commission which we hope will be presented to government in the next few months', 'this will afford us the opportunity to understand a critical part of our past and join hands in forging a peoples contract for a better tomorrow', 'as we enter the last year of the first decade of freedom we will heed the lessons of these first ten years and build on what has been achieved', 'through dispassionate research and systematic planning and with renewed courage we must together approach the second decade of freedom    as one in which the tide of progress will sweep away the accumulated legacy of poverty and underdevelopment', 'it is in this spirit that we shall prepare for a fitting celebration of our ten years of freedom next year', 'i wish our national provincial and local legislatures success as they discharge their responsibilities to our country and people during this final year of our first decade of liberation', 'the tide has turned', 'the peoples contract for a better tomorrow is taking shape', 'i trust that all of us will identify with this historic process', 'given the great possibility we have to move forward we dare not falter', 'thank you']"

destruction in the history of our democracy causing over  deaths', 'last year parts of the eastern cape kwazulunatal and north west were struck by catastrophic flooding that caused extensive loss of life the destruction of homes and damage to infrastructure', 'and now persistent loadshedding is impeding our recovery from the effects of these events', 'we know that without a reliable supply of electricity businesses cannot grow assembly lines cannot run crops cannot be irrigated and basic services are interrupted', 'loadshedding means that households and supermarkets are unable to keep food fresh water supply is often disrupted traffic lights do not work and streets are not lit at night', 'without a reliable supply of electricity our efforts to grow an inclusive economy that creates jobs

problem today to keep the lights on tomorrow and for generations to come', 'in july last year i announced a clear action plan to address the energy crisis', 'this was to address the electricity

accelerate private investment in generation capacity', 'three accelerate procurement of new capacity from renewables gas and battery storage', 'four unleash businesses and households to invest in rooftop solar', 'five fundamentally transform the electricity sector to achieve longterm energy security', 'experts agree that this plan is the most realistic route to end loadshedding', 'during the last six months we have made important progress in implementing the plan', 'we have taken steps to improve the performance of eskoms existing power stations so that the coalfired power stations that provide  of our electricity produce the amount of electricity for which they were designed', 'under its new board eskom is deploying people and resources to improve the reliability of the six power stations that have contributed the most to loadshedding', 'eskom is urgently fasttracking construction of a temporary solution to bring back three units at kusile power station following the collapse of a chimney stack last year whilst simultaneously repairing the permanent structure', 'we are rebuilding the skills that have been lost and have already recruited skilled personnel at senior levels

that is equitable and fair to all stakeholders which will enable the utility to make necessary investments in maintenance and transmission', 'government will support eskom to secure additional funding to purchase diesel for the rest of the financial year', 'this should reduce the severity of loadshedding as eskom will be able to use its dieselrun plants when the system is under strain', 'eskom has launched a programme to buy excess power from private generators and has already secured  mw from our neighbouring countries', 'the south african police service saps has established a dedicated team with senior leadership to deal with the pervasive corruption and theft at several power stations that has contributed to the poor performance of these stations', 'intelligencedriven operations at

will be soon operational with an independent board', 'later this year we will table the electricity regulation amendment bill to transform the energy sector and establish a competitive electricity

emergency power that can be deployed within six months to close the immediate gap', 'we are investing in new transmission lines and substations especially in areas such as the eastern cape northern

time of crisis we need a single point of command and a single line of march', 'just as we address the cause of the crisis we also need to address its impact', 'the crisis has progressively evolved to affect every part of society', 'we must act to lessen the impact of the crisis on farmers on small businesses on our water infrastructure and our transport network', 'the national disaster management centre has consequently classified the energy crisis and its impact as a disaster', 'we are therefore declaring a national state of disaster to respond to the electricity crisis and its effects', 'the minister of cooperative governance and traditional affairs has just gazetted the declaration of the state of disaster which will begin with immediate effect', 'the state of disaster will enable us to provide practical measures that we need to take to support businesses in the food production storage and retail supply chain including for the rollout of generators solar panels and uninterrupted power supply', 'where technically possible it will enable us to exempt critical infrastructure such as hospitals and water treatment plants from loadshedding', 'and it will enable us to accelerate

continuous monitoring of expenditure in order to guard against any abuses of the funds needed to attend to this disaster', 'to deal more effectively and urgently with the challenges that confront us i

remove any confusion the minister of public enterprises will remain the shareholder representative of eskom and steer the restructuring of eskom ensure the establishment of the transmission company oversee the implementation of the just energy transition programme and oversee the establishment of the stateowned enterprises soes holding company', 'the process of restructuring government will give us an opportunity to determine the positioning of various areas of responsibilities and how best the various ministries and departments can best serve our national objectives', 'we are focusing our attention on the energy crisis right now and will address the restructuring of government in due course', 'this is necessary because an effective response to this crisis involves several different departments and entities that require coordination from the centre of government', 'we will be including other social partners in an effective structure similar to the one we set up to drive the vaccine rollout', 'extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures', 'the energy crisis is an existential threat to our economy and social fabric', 'we must spare no effort and we must allow no delay in implementing these measures', 'as we take these actions to resolve the energy crisis we are mindful of the risks that climate change poses to our society', 'extreme weather events in the form of drought floods and wild fires increasingly pose a risk to the health wellbeing and safety of people', 'we will continue our just transition to a low carbon economy at a pace our country can afford and in a manner that ensures energy security', 'we will undertake our just transition in a way that opens up the possibility of new investments new industrialisation and that above all

frontiers such as renewable energy green hydrogen and electric vehicles', 'several new sectors are emerging in the economy such as major green hydrogen electric vehicles and fuel cells', 'a number of projects are already underway including the development of a new facility by sasol at boegoebaai in the northern cape the prieska power reserve in the free state and the hydrogen valley initiative in limpopo gauteng and kwazulunatal', 'the northern cape has already attracted well over r billion in investments in renewable energy projects', 'these and other massive investments in renewable energy will create jobs and stimulate local economies not only in the northern cape but also in the eastern cape western cape and mpumalanga turning even the most arid desert into a giant energy source', 'above all our just transition will prioritise workers and communities in vulnerable industries to ensure that no one is left behind', 'fellow south africans    our economy needs to grow much faster if we are to meaningfully reduce unemployment', 'in the sona last year we spoke of our intention to forge a comprehensive social compact that would join all social partners in a common programme to rebuild our economy and enable higher growth', 'we were not able to conclude a social compact in the timeframe we had envisaged because a number of new circumstances emerged that made it difficult for social partners to forge a consensus', 'the social partners have expressed their intention to conclude a social compact and have continued to work on a framework to enable joint action in key areas such as energy transport and logistics employment creation and skills development investment and localisation social protection crime and corruption', 'while we remain committed to forging a new consensus among all sectors of our society we have also undertaken practical collaboration in specific areas', 'a number of other compacts have been concluded amongst social partners', 'we see the commitment of all social partners in the compacts that have been forged to fight the covid pandemic and undertake the largest vaccination programme in our history', 'we have seen it in initiatives like the solidarity fund that mobilised society citizen activism and funding to achieve common goals and in partnerships to end genderbased violence and femicide gbvf and to respond to the effects of climate change', 'we have seen the benefits of this approach to promote investment and to develop master plans in sectors of the economy such as automotive clothing and textiles poultry sugar agriculture and global business services', 'the master plans that have been concluded are supporting the revival of the relevant sectors the injection of investment by the private sector and the creation of new jobs and livelihoods', 'we are pleased that social partners particularly business has been providing support to implement the energy action plan in the spirit of social compacting', 'similarly we have developed a close working partnership with both labour and community in supporting other aspects of the energy crisis response', 'just as energy is essential for economic growth so is a reliable water supply and an efficient transport and road infrastructure system', 'our rail network has suffered from many years of underinvestment lack of maintenance criminal activity and
