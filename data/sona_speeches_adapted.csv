confidence of the population in the democratic process be again show during the local government election at the same time the institution charge with safeguard constitutional freedom such a the human right commission the land commission and the office of the public protector have be form the constitutional court have in it one year of existence firmly assert itself a an independent impartial and authorita tive guardian of the constitution in brief south african politics be ascend to the level of normalcy where civilise standard of political relation will be entrench unmediated by antagonistic conflict or administrative intervention the progress we have make across the board be a result in great measure of the intervention of honourable member gather here and the provincial legislator in set the parameter and direction of transformation in your devote the citizenry performance of these elect institution our legislature be in the first instance the custodian of the new system and secondly the body through which the programme of reconstruction and development nationbuilding and reconciliation can and should be codify and turn into a living reality yes south africa be not only on the right road we be well on our way to make this the country of our dream i take the opportunity to congratulate all south african in the public and private sector the most prominent in the land a well a the humble member of the community all of whom be strive to add another brick to the edifice of our democracy we have set out on this road together and we should together aim for the star madame speakerif these achievement be something to be proud of this be because they have laid the foundation to make a real impact on the inequity of the past for we be only at the begin of a long journey a journey we should undertake with expedition if our con science be not impervious to the cry of desperation of million but this be a journey too that require thorough planning and tenacious industry if we be to remain on course and capable of sustain our march let me preface the identification of the challenge of the come year by say that all of u all south african be call upon to become builder and healer but for all the joy and excitement of creation to build and to heal be difficult undertaking we can neither heal nor build if such heal and building be perceive a oneway process with the victim of past injustice forgive and the beneficiary merely content in gratitude together we must set out to correct the defect of the past we can neither heal nor build if on the one hand the rich in our society see the poor a horde of irritant or if on the other hand the poor sit back expect charity all of u must take responsibility for the upliftment of our condition prepared to give our best to the benefit of all we can neither heal nor build if we continue to have people in position of influence and power who at best pay lip service to affirmative action black empowerment and the emancipation of woman or who be in reality oppose to these goal if we have people who continue with blind arrogance to practice racism in the workplace and school despite the appeal we make in our very first address to this parliament we must work together to ensure the equitable distribution of wealth opportunity and power in our society we can not build or heal our nation if in both the private and public sector in the school and university in the hospi tals and on the land in deal with crime and social dislocation if we continue with business a usual wallow in notion of the past everywhere and in everything we do what be now require be boldness in think firmness in resolve and consistency in action the message i be try to convey be that all of u must take the national project of accelerate and fundamental transformation of our country very seriously indeed the achievement of the objective of equity nonracialism and nonsexism constitute the very essence of the new society we seek to build in the history of nation generation have make their mark through their acumen to appreciate critical turn point and with determination and creativity to seize the moment south africa be well on it way to a new and well life this we will achieve only if we shed the temptation to proceed casually along th road only if we fully take the opportunity that beckon we must unite in a new patriotism to achieve the goal of create a new society madame speakerthe potential for economic growth and development be well than in many decade but let u be brutally frank despite the welcome rate of growth very few job have be create in fact against the backdrop of new entrant into the job market there have be a shrinkage in opportunity we need a national vision to lift u out of this quagmire if we do not act together in the public and private sector to develop and implement such a national strategic vision the danger be that even the modest growth we have attain will peter out in a matter of a few year a the strain of limited capacity skill shortage balance of payment and other constraint start to gather momentum and a increase unemployment and accelerate poverty bear down on our society to move forward with purpose require that we extricate the public and private sector from the current comfort zone and break through the threshold to achieve a rate of growth sufficient to create job and generate resource for rapid socioeconomic programme to uplift the poor for purpose of emphasis let me identify three important investment challenge and attendant difficult choice that have to be make firstly we require major investment in infrastructure include such area a municipal service housing and construction and telecommunication in order to create job at the same time a we improve service to the citizenry a we enter these area in a decisive manner the question will arise over and over again whether we can attain our objective if the profit motive be the only dynamo of our actionssecondly we need investment and restructuring of manufacturing and other industry such a tourism agriculture and mining which be critical for export and foreign exchange earnings related to this for instance be the challenge whether we can continue with the same structure of our agricultural industry give our capricious climatic conditionsthirdly none of the economic objective we aspire to can be realise without massive investment in people i refer here to question of skill development adult education and the overhaul of our entire education system a well a health and other service which i will return to later indeed a we struggle to widen the skill base and to absorb more people into the economy the challenge will continue to face organise labour and the employ in general include the manager can we succeed if we premise our action narrowly on the interest of those who be already economically engagedwhen all be say and do we return again to the challenge of a new south african patriotism that at the end of each day everyone of u should afford a smile in his or her face when we pose to ourselves the question what have i do today to create job and improve my skill and those of othersas government we fully acknowledge the critical role that we need to play in realise the vision of growth and development i wish to emphasise that over the past year government have move to a new level of coordination that be unprecedented in the history of our country it be quite clear to u that success in achieve the growth and development objective we have identify require integration of planning and operation across department and province important crosssectoral meeting and intergovern mental forum be be held to elaborate the growth and development strategy and the institutional mechanism require to drive it i should personally make the observation that we be finally succeed in galvanise government to give effective leadership to economic growth and development within week we should be able to make major announcement on the progress make in order to improve the investment climate our monetary authority be review on an ongoing basis the timing and pace of lift exist exchange control for u it be not a matter of whether but of when these control will be phase out it be critical if we have to promote competitiveness export and the creation of job that we should have in place the necessary supplyside measure already consensus be be reach in nedlac about the require incentive that will help boost training pro ductivity work organisation and investment in particular industry and region arguably the most important measure in this regard pertain to the development of small and mediumsized business relevant legislation on these issue a well a the critical question of competitive practice in the economy should come before parliament during the course of this session i be convince that the various roleplayers in the economy have long pass question the need or otherwise for such competitive practice and the longterm benefit this will bring to the economy include big and small company i hope too that legislation on employment equity and standard will be pass in this session with the support of all relevant stakeholder this should also be the case with the restructuring of public asset in order to use them to accelerate growth and development attune them with modern level of technology reorganise them to expand service to all citizen and reshape them in line with the imperative of internal democracy it be to be expect that such a massive undertaking should generate much debate among the public and the work class in particular what be clear though be that there be a breakdown of communication which precipitate unnecessary acrimony on an issue that should enjoy the support of all interested party i be happy that the national framework agreement negotiate between government and the trade union be adopt by cabinet two day ago therefore the government relationship with labour from the level of the executive a a whole to the department and the management of public enterprise must be set on a viable footing to ensure cooperative rather than confrontational interaction we be confident that the restructuring programme will be carry out with due speed and carry out in a manner that involves and benefit all stakeholder madame speaker and honourable membersit be the firm view of the government of national unity that the growth and development strategy should be pursue in an integrate manner we do not subscribe to the notion that growth on it own can rectify the backlog of apartheid in a mysterious trickledown fashion in any case in our skewed social structure there can not be growth without development area of development that protect and improve our human resource four important area identify themselves for special mention the first area be education on this the 20th anniversary of the student uprise and the oaudeclared year of education in africa we face the stark reality that south africa lag behind many african country in so far a literacy and other human development indicator be concerned we owe it to that corp of brave young people who rise up against the apartheid system to institute far measure this year decisively to move towards a nonracial democratic and equitable education system if anything the matric result last year and the reality of child in the northern province and elsewhere whose class have to scatter in disarray at the first sign of rain be a stark reminder of how far we still be from that goal clearly rectify these imbalance will require redistribution of the limited resource among race and province it will also require even great commitment to teach and to learn from teacher and student alike and i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate them a well a the parent for the stability that have set in in our institution of learn two day ago cabinet adopt the white paper on education the centrepiece of such restructuring should be the establishment of a qualitydriven public school system available to all south african child among other thing that should drive this be democratic governance involve parent teacher and student at secondary level a curriculum and careerguidance scheme that be more appropriate to the need of the country and community involvement adult basic education and earlyat university and technikon level it be necessary that the debate on transformation start in earnest in an organise manner so that policy position can emerge to guide these autonomous institution a one measure of our commitment to tackle the backlog in the building of school r1billion have be allocate for this purpose a far r300million have be set aside for a student financing support scheme for university and technikons the matter of retrenchment of teacher have once again arisen though in a sensational and unfortunate manner today i once more wish to reassure teacher that this government be commit to redeploy rather than retrench teacher any other approach would not make sense give the need in many part of the country this process itself will be the subject of extensive consultation and only in extreme case will the possibility of retrenchment be consider i hope that this year will see cooperation among all party in these chamber to facilitate educational reform pronouncement about economic growth sound hollow if they be follow up by attempt to block by hook or by crook legislation meant to equip child with the require skill declaration of loyalty to democracy can only be but mere word if in actual practice people be see to defend island of white privilege the second important area be health delivery many step have be take to introduce a new health policy base principally on greatly expand the primary health care system the clinicbuild ing programme often seem insignificant by the standard of those who have resource in abundance but in the rural area and sprawl urban settlement this be a matter literally of life and death it be therefore of great significance that we have move from the planning stage to actual implementation during the course of last year many ugly incident take place which brought to the fore the terrible condition under which health worker operate let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to them for their selfless service to community while we strongly disapprove of some of these incident we fully appreciate their plight discussion be at an advanced stage to formulate a new grade system and avail incentive especially in rural area like with all other profession we value very highly the service of doctor and other health worker and we shall do our best to ensure their security i should once more emphasise the need for a massive education campaign on the aid epidemic and commend the relevant ministry for the work they be do in this regard we dare remind our self that all the objective we outline here will not be po sible to attain if the aid epidemic be not brought under control policy and implementation it be a matter of common knowledge painfully common to those without housing that many constraint have bedevil the proper implementation of this programme but the stay power of this democratic government be it preparedness to acknowledge weakness and strive to rectify them such be the quality of the minister and staff that they have critically and openly examine these problem and identify corrective measure what be clear from their decision be that we need not one but many integrate campaign to deal with the housing problem these includegreater commitment on the part of financial institution to allocate resource to poor area andfirm indication from community that the rent and service boycott have in the spirit of masakhane come to an end over and above these issue we can not over emphasise the centrality particularly of local government in the housing programme the provision of infrastructure and related campaign we also need to examine the pertinent question of the integration of our city too many of the lowcost housing initiative be mere addition to apartheid black township saddle with the same problem of distance from workplace and lack of proper community facility to address this will require a creative approach among others to the question of residential density which will also help to reduce infrastructural cost include those related to public transport the fourth area pertains to land reform i be certain that all of u welcome the passing of the bill on security of tenure and the launch last week of the green paper on land reform when finalise the policy adopt will form an important part of our rural development strategy for the first time in century family turn into insecure sojourner in the land of their birth can talk of real security soon the land claim court will begin it work and we be confident that it will deal with the complex problem in a manner that ensures justice and promotes the agricultural interest of the country no one have reason to fear the aim of government be to build not to destroy in these four area of our socioeconomic programme and others what be require be a partnership among all sector community government and the private sector thus when we talk of the new patriotism we be talk also of effort of community to build one another and together build their future we be talk of masakhanemadame speakerthe question need to be pose whether we do indeed have a state machinery capable of meeting the objective of growth and developmenti should start off by thank all minister the public service commission and head of department sincerely for their effort in this difficult transitional period steadily progress be be register in make the public service broadly representative of society from a trifle of 6 today black manager constitute 37 of this echelon from less than 5 female now constitute 10 of management progress yes but not nearly enough the public service commission have place on the table a new salary and grade system which contains within it the potential to redress past inequality stabilise labour relation and promote reform of the service government support this proposal in principle and discussion be continue on way of financing it we be confident that when finalise the white paper and legislation will enjoy the support of worker and manager alike all of whom will have fully participate in their formulation yet all this do not resolve some of the complex and immediate problem arise from the apartheid past let u remind ourselves of this government mandate which be to establish a single streamline efficient and transparent public service and to allocate more public resource to capital expenditure let u be frank and say that the current service be too large and it have to be rationalise there be no other option however our action can not ignore the painful truth that the most affected will be area that be poor with low economic activity and little prospect for alternative employment this mean among other thing search for creative negotiate solution that will help stimulate economic activity the rationalisation process will not be vindictive neither will it be carry out in a haphazard manner rather it will affect all race and province discussion be well advanced with the relevant ministry to set up the presidential review commission which will redefine the structure function and procedure of the public service and relevant announcement can be expect soon among the great challenge for 1996 be to far build the capacity of government to serve community nowhere be this need more than at local level where government interacts on a daily basis with community it should therefore be the case that one of the main theme of this year will be the introduction of massive training programme for the newlyelected councillor and their staff local government must be give the necessary capacity not only to handle finance and render efficient and affordable service it be critical that accountability and mobilisation of community should also form part of their ethos this elect official at local level should know that in the final analysis nation building and reconciliation economic growth and development will depend largely on the performance of local council despite prediction to the contrary the people show their confidence in the new democracy and reaffirm their mandate to the government of national unite in the november election our task at all level be to justify that trust and confidence by mobilise them to work together for an improvement in their condition of life it be part of that mandate to ensure that there be cooperative governance among all tier so that national provincial and local government complement one another in kwazulunatal and part of the western cape where local election will take place in may we expect and should work for campaign that be free of violence and intimidation campaign which promote unity in our diversity we hope that all the party within andoutside this chamber will openly commit themselves to the conduct of free and fair election honourable membersthe national effort to improve the quality of life of the people mean also that each citizen and each community should enjoy security in the home at work and in the street we believe that it have now dawn on all present here that deal with crime and violence require a comprehensive strategy and hard work rather than just injunction from election platform i be happy to announce that cabinet will soon unveil the national crime prevention strategy for public comment this strategy brings together the combine effort of the police judiciary and prison authority in an effective criminal justice system the aim be not only to improve the capacity of police to prevent crime and apprehend criminal but it be also to ensure that they be dealt with to the full extent of the law and properly rehabilitate we commend the business community for the campaign they have launch against crime and corruption some of the practical step that they have take be start to bear fruit and the many proposal from their conference will form part of the strategy we have refer to within community cooperation with the police be improve by the day with positive result no one can doubt the commitment of the south african police service to deal with crime and we pay tribute to them for daily put their life in danger in the service of their country great progress have be make in transform this institution integrate the various service introduce civilian oversight and ensure professionalism in their operation the dedication with which the leadership of the service have go about root out corruption and take the war to the syndicate and other criminal should be commend and the abide lesson from their success be that this can only be accomplish with the cooperation of community and individual citizen we should also remind ourselves over and over again that crime constitutes more than just drug traffic and car hijack when ton and ton of vegetable disappear without trace in a city council depot this be criminal conduct of the bad order when billion be siphon off from company and out of the country this be criminal robbery of the nation resource when food and fund meant for school child be steal this be criminal plunder against our child and our future a particular feature of crime in our country be the violence afflict kwazulunatal the taxi industry a well a bizarre incident of gang warfare and other murder by any name and under any guise this be criminal conduct and it should be dealt with a such incident in the kwazulunatal south coast where individual have organise themselves to undermine physically and otherwise investigation into the murder which take place over the holiday period arm with an assortment of weapon they have take it upon themselves in full view of the public medium to challenge the nation lawenforcement agency i be today issue a strong warn to these element that this can not be allow to continue the time have come for our nation to choose whether we want to become a lawgoverned and peaceful society or hapless hostage of lawlessness i have discuss this matter with the ministry and the leadership of the police service and they have assure me that strong action will be take in addition to this i wish to announce today that preparation be under way to introduce measure that will prohibit the carry of dangerous weapon in public manifestation no one irrespective of organisation to which they may belong will be exempt from these measure deal with crime violence and corruption require a new morality for our new nation indeed it require a new patriotism among community the public and private sector and the security service so that at the end of each day each one of u can answer in the affirmative the question have i do something today to stamp out crimethe performance of the nation against crime depends heavily on the intelligence capacity of the security service a a whole on this depends also the security of our democracy and i should pay tribute to the unsung hero in the intelligence community who be contribute immensely to our success in this regard i also wish to reiterate the government commitment to protect the right of privacy and ensure the security of all individual in public service a well a other citizen this be the code of conduct which guide all our security service however in ply their dubious trade criminal should not hope to hide behind these provision of our constitution the government will use all lawful mean to ensure that they do not succeed in undermine our social fabric lawabiding citizen can rest assure that there be effective mechanism in place to prevent and punish any rapacious invasion of their life our security service be commit to follow the rule because they know a much a we all do that anything else be a sure recipe for the decay of our democratic system for a psychosis of fear and a slide into authoritarianism the government include the security service will not allow this to happen tribute also go to the south african national defence force which have distinguish itself in the integration process in far enhance it legitimacy in the eye of our people and the international community and in assist the police service to deal with crime and violence a should be expect the new political milieu have dictate that we scale down the resource allocate to the defence force this be a difficult and painful process particularly for the citizen in uniform but we wish to assure them that the aim have never be and will never be to undermine this important national resource there be national consensus that our defence force require an appropriate capacity and modern equipment we welcome the fact that debate on these issue be now find rational reflection in the discussion around the defence white paper and the national defence review these process should be complete during the course of this year so that we can achieve certainty and a national policy to which all of u can pay allegiance madam speakerif during the course of the past year south africa afford it citizen unprecedented freedom and a human right culture the frontier be bound to widen immeasurably in 1996 the new patriotism abroad in our nation be a reflection of how liberate democracy be for all our citizen in their rainbow colour no longer be the state a mighty colossus intimidate everyone in it wake the openness in this and other legislature the transparency of the executive and the participatory style of government all these have give practical meaning to the concept of government by the people for the people in addition to the independent institution such a the constitutional court which i mention earlier the truth and reconciliation commission will help cement democracy by lay bare that which our nation should never again experience it will entrench justice by afford victim the reparation due to them it will through this and by mean of amnesty ensure last reconciliation a with other such institution the truth and reconciliation commission will succeed only if it get the cooperation of all of u i call on all south african to respect the commission independence and impartiality it integrity and good faith the commissioner themselves have reiterate what the found legislation pronounces that the aim of their work be justice and reconciliation not vengeance the frontier of our freedom be bound to widen this year principally because the permanent basic law of the land will be adopt by the constitutional assembly a few month remain before the deadline set in the interim constitution expires we should burn the midnight oil to meet this deadline and achieve normal democratic principle accepted everywhere in the world it be also crucial that we attain constitutional certainty both for ourselves and in our relation with the international community many difficult issue need to be resolve question of democratic majority rule cooperative governance universally accepted human right and language equity be only some of them a in the past these matter can only be resolve in genuine negotiation in the spirit of give and take the new constitution must be inclusive a basic law of the land to which all sector of society can pay allegiance it behoves all member and party in the constitutional assembly to take full part in the work of the assembly and fulfil the mandate of their supporter and in all instance we should be guide by the imperative to make our country a truly nonracial and nonsexist democracy it citizen united by equity in their diversity these be the principle which should also guide u in protect and advance member of our society who have suffer undue privation under apartheid woman and youth in particular honourable member will agree with me that we can not allow parliament

government commitment to introduce programme that will ensure that the disabled can realise their full potential a we deepen our democracy and make progress in our trans formation it be to be expect that south africa will be call upon to relate to the international community more a an equal partner rather than a mere beneficiary of solidarity this we should be proud of because it reflect the confidence the world have in the progress we be make towards create a normal society in addition to host important event of the southern african region world conference on critical socioeconomic

should govern our country the honourable nelson mandela issue an historic challenge thatwe must constrain by and yet regardless of the accumulate effect of our historical burden seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our share destiny perhaps what the nation have do and not do during the year of the democratic epoch that have accumulate since nelson mandela deliver the first state of the nation address on 24 may 1994 have create the possibility for u to reiterate the call he make on that day to all of u a south african nearly twelve year ago together to define for ourselves what we want to make of our share destiny on that day in may 1994 the hon nelson mandela evoke the haunt memory of an extraordinary south african ingrid jonker who commit suicide just over 40 year ago in the same sea water that isolated his former involuntary temporary home robben island from our mainland a she be isolated from and by her kith and kin of her he saidin the midst of despair she celebrate hope confront with death she assert the beauty of life in the dark day when all seem hopeless in our country when many refuse to hear her resonant voice she take her own life to her and others like her we owe a debt to life itself to her and others like her we owe a commitment to the poor the oppress the wretched and the despise nelson mandela say that in the aftermath of the massacre at the antipass demonstration in sharpeville langa and nyanga she write thatdie kind be nie dood nie die kind lig sy vuiste teen sy moeder wat afrika skreeu die kind wat net wou speel in die son by nyanga al oral die kind wat n man geword het trek deur die ganse afrika die kind wat n reus geword het real deur die hele wreld sonder n pa the child be not deadthe child lift his fist against his motherwho shout africa this child who only want to play in the sun at nyanga be everywherethe child grown to a man trek on through all africathe child grown to a giant journey through the whole worldwithout a passnelson mandela continuedand in this glorious vision ingrid jonker instructs that our endeavour must be about the liberation of the woman the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child it be these thing that we must achieve to give meaning to our presence in this chamber and give purpose to our occupancy of the seat of government and so we must constrain by and yet regardless of the accumulate effect of our historical burden seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our share destiny confront by this historic challenge i dare say that no one in our country can like shakespeare macbeth grieve that in the period since that distinguish son of our people the honourable nelson mandela deliver our first state of the nation address all we can truthfully say with macbeth about our country fate istomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrowcreeps in this petty pace from day to dayto the last syllable of record timeand all our yesterday have light foolsthe way to dusty deathindeed i believe that for many of u our country evolution away from it apartheid past seem to have move at such a hectic pace that even some of the seminal moment mark the birth of our democracy that be less than two decade old present themselves in the subconscious mind a be mere chapter in an age historical record of a distant past nothing that have happen during the age of democracy could justify the conclusion similar to the one that macbeth arrive at that any of our yesterday have only serve to guide fool to avoidable catastrophe on the contrary the age of democracy have give itself moral legitimacy by ensure that ingrid jonker life on a heroine to all our people the child she knew have not die despite the apartheid bullet through it head and now grown to a giant trek on through all africa and the whole world without a passthis year we will have occasion to remind ourselves of and celebrate two of the seminal moment to which i have refer one of these be the 15th anniversary of the hold of the first meeting of convention for a democratic south africa codesa on 20 december 1991 and the adoption of the vitally important declaration of intent the follow day the other be the 10th anniversary of the adoption of our constitution on 8 may 1996 among other thing the codesa declaration of intent say wedeclare our solemn commitment to bring about an undivided south africa with one nation share a common citizenship patriotism and loyalty pursue amidst our diversity freedom equality and security for all irrespective of race colour sex or creed a country free from apartheid or any other form of discrimination or domination the importance of this particular moment in our history both for our country and the people of the world be underlined by the presence at codesa of international observer from the united nation the organisation of african unity the movement of nonaligned country and the commonwealth in a joint statement these representative of important international organisation say codesa must herald the dawn of a new era of peace and justice the broad objective express in the declaration of intent be a most constructive and auspicious begin for codesa and give promise of attainment of a true democracy for south africawe hope that all the representative of the south african people will join in the rebuild of their country period of a decade and a decadeandahalf be but fleeting moment in the life of any nation in our case we have live through these year conscious of the enormous effort it would require of all of u to unshackle our country from the heavy chain that tie it to it past we have know that it would take considerable time before we could say we have eradicate the legacy of the past we have expect that the circumstance hand down to u by our history would indeed condemn u to a petty pace of progress towards the achievement of the goal of a well life for all and yet today a i stand here to speak to the honourable member of our national provincial and local legislature an important component part of our national political leadership other echelon of that leadership and our international guest i feel embolden to appropriate for our people the promise contain in the book of the prophet isaiah when god saidfor you shall go out with joyand be lead out in peacethe mountain and the hillsshall

two month after our nation establish codesa the then chairperson of the united nation special committee against apartheid saidduring the next few month the special committee will need to closely

violence the level and the nature of violence continue to be extremely disturb more than 2 600 person lose their life in 1991 a a result of politically related violence reading this today wonder what could have go wrong that so many people have to lose their life needlessly it becomes difficult to avoid the conclusion that yesterday be another countryand yet during the very same year that we adopt our constitution amnesty international could still report thatat least 500 people be kill in continue political violence in kwazulunatal some appear to have be extrajudicially execute report of torture and illtreatment in police custody continued four people be kill by rightwing opponent of the government far evidence emerge through court proceeding and truth and reconciliation commission hearing of official involvement in human right violation under the former government fifteen year ago the international community be express deep concern about factor threaten to derail the process in our country towards end white minority rule include the violence then claim too many life and found it necessary to appeal to all our people to act together to end apartheid and rebuild the country the people of the world could have reiterate their concern about political violence in our country even five year later a we take the giant step forward by adopt our constitution happily in time we manage to break free of the uncertainty about a bright future for our country dramatically represent by the large number of people kill throughout the year from 1990 to 1996 when we be engage in

optimism index gallup international which issue this report say we have three time more optimist than pessimist and that the optimism figure have double even since 2002 this compare sharply with the situation in 1993 when our country be still in the grip of the crisis that have be of so much concern to the international community that year our country have more pessimist than optimist signify the prevalence of a mood of despair generate in part by the coldblooded assassination that year of one of our outstanding leader chris hani the result obtain by gallup international have be confirm by a recent domestic poll conduct by markinor accord to this poll 65 of our people believe that the country be go in the right direction 84 think that our country hold out a happy future for all racial

optimistic about the year ahead make them the third most optimistic internationally again last month the first national bank and the bureau for economic research report that the consumer confidence index be at it high in 25 year what all these figure signify be that our people be firmly convince that our country have enter it age of hope they be convince that we have create the condition to achieve more rapid progress towards the realisation of their dream they be certain that we be indeed a win nation through our national effort they can see the relevance to our situation of god blessing communicate in the book of the prophet isaiahfor you shall go out with joyand be lead out in peacethe mountain and the hillsshall break forth into sing before youand all the tree of the field shall clap their hand instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress treeand instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree the inspire perspective about our future share by the majority of our people derives from what our country have achieve first to overcome the obstacle to freedom we face before 1994 the advance we have make since then to consolidate our democracy while promote nonracism and nonsexism the progress we have make to alleviate the poverty afflict million of our people and the stride we have make to expand and modernise our economy we owe these outstanding achievement to the sterling effort make by all our people in all walk of life to that extent i would like to take the opportunity of this state of the nation address to salute and thank all our people for respond to the call make by nelson mandela in 1994 from this podium when he say we must constrain by and yet regardless of the accumulate effect of our historical burden seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our share destiny million do indeed seize the time and in action define ours a a share destiny of peace democracy nonracism nonsexism share prosperity and a well life for all it be because of what these million do that our people know from their own experience that today be well than yesterday and be confident that tomorrow will be well than today while we must indeed

economic growth and development of at least 6 a year we must sustain and improve the effectiveness of our social development programme target at provide a cushion of support to those most expose to the threat of abject poverty we must act more aggressively with regard to our criminal justice system to improve the safety and security of our people especially by improve the function of our court and increase our conviction rate to strengthen the message that crime do not pay we must ensure that the machinery of government especially the local government sphere discharge it responsibility effectively and efficiently honour the precept of batho pele and we must harness the proudly south african spirit that be abroad among the people to build the strong possible partnership between all section of our population to accelerate our advance towards the realisation of the important goal of a well life for all our government be commit to respond with all necessary seriousness and

input into an important initiative that must be own and implement by our people a a whole i must also take advantage of this occasion to explain that asgisa be not intend to cover all element of a comprehensive development plan rather it consists of a limited set of intervention that be intend to serve a catalyst to accelerate and share growth and development otherwise we will continue to engage the nation and all social partner to address other element of a comprehensive development plan to improve on our current programme and deal with other issue such a the comprehensive industrial policy keep in mind the objective to halve poverty and unemployment by 2014 our government be convince that favourable condition exist for u to achieve the accelerate and share growth to which we be commit for instance on 3 january 2005 the newspaper business day comment thatin south africa this promise to be the dawn of a golden age of growthwe have now have more than five year of sustain growth an upswing longer than the boom of the 1960s and indeed longer than anything in the postwar periodwe be reap the benefit of year of sound financial and monetary policy a well a of structural reform in the economy we be set fairer than we have be in decade to raise the growth rate on a sustainable basis the trouble be not all of it be within our control a much depends on the vagary of world market and the global economybut make no mistakethis economy and this market start to look very different to anything we be use to and it be certainly a different good not a different bad we fully agree with these observation and would add that that different good have include significant job creation a trend that we seek to enhance through asgisa and our other development programme to implement asgisa the stateowned enterprise and the public sector a a whole work in some instance through publicprivate partnership will make large investment in various sector to meet the demand for electricity provide an efficient and competitive logistic infrastructure expand and modernise the telecommunication infrastructure and satisfy the demand for water the public sector will also accelerate

multipurpose government service centre include police station and court r372 billion will be provide for both these set of programme over the next three year a the honourable member would expect we will continue to pay particular attention to the expand public work programme a an important bridge between the two economy and a significant part of our poverty alleviation programme among other thing resource for the public work programme will be pool to ensure maximum impact both in term of product deliver and employment and skillstraining opportunity well supervision of infrastructure project undertaken by government will be introduce to ensure that capital budget be spent without rollover and that labourintensive method be prioritise and the necessary training of worker be carry out to provide them with skill asgisa have also identify particular sector of our economy for accelerate growth building on the work already do within the context of our exist microeconomic reform programme these include business process outsource tourism chemical biofuels metal and metallurgy wood pulp and paper agriculture the creative industry and clothing and textile in this regard work be proceed apace to address such challenge a the cost of telecommunication and import parity pricing with regard to steel and chemical we have already reach agreement with the people republic of china to protect our clothing and textile sector the second national telecommunication operator should become operational later this year for asgisa to succeed it be clear that the machinery of state and especially local government should function effectively and efficiently during the past year our government have undertaken a detailed assessment to determine what we need to do to improve the capacity of our system of local government a we announce last year we have be engage in assess the capacity of government to discharge it responsibility to help accelerate the process of social transformation proceed from the particular to the general the audit of a number of national department have be complete these include housing health education and trade and industry across all these issue of skill vacancy delegation of responsibility to manager of delivery agency and relationship between national and provincial department have emerge a be among the most critical area require attention assessment of the other department will be carry out the government will make the necessary intervention to address the issue raise by these assessment bearing in mind the critical role that government must play a one of our country most important developmental agency we can not allow that government department become an obstacle to the achievement of the goal of a well life for all because of insufficient attention to the critical issue of effective and speedy delivery of service in this context we will continue the work towards the creation of one public service cover all sphere of government fully conscious of the complexity of this matter and the need to secure the agreement of all relevant stakeholder we will also continue to pay the necessary attention to the important issue of the inclusion of woman and people with disability at decisionmaking level of the public service everything we have say so far concern asgisa point to the inescapable conclusion that to meet our objective we will have to pay particular attention to the issue of scarce skill that will negatively affect the capacity of both the public and the private sector to meet the goal set by asgisa in this regard i would therefore like to assure the honourable member and the country a a whole that together with our social partner we have agree to a vigorous and wideranging skill development and acquisition programme to meet any shortfall we may experience among other thing we have already agree to establish within a few week a multistakeholder work group jipsa the joint initiative on priority skill acquisition through which government business labour and civil society will act jointly to respond to the skill challenge in a practical a manner a possible i would like to extend the sincere thanks of our deputy president and government a a whole to the response of the freedom front and other formation and individual who have respond to our appeal for south african

leadership of our tertiary institution focus on work with them to meet the nation expectation with regard to teach and research for it part the government be determine to increase the resource allocation for research and development and innovation and increase the pool of young researcher asgisa identify other constraint to growth and development apart from the issue of skill the cost of do business and the unnecessarily high cost of intermediate input work be proceed to address all these constraint include the limited domestic market and monetary and financial issue asgisa have once more confirm the need for u to expand our small medium and micro enterprise smme sector pay particular attention in this regard to broadbased black economic empowerment and the development of woman and the youth we will therefore take the necessary measure to ensure the effectiveness of such exist programme a the apex microcredit fund mafisa for agricultural development seda the small enterprise development agency khula the msobomvu youth fund the idc small business initiative and so on we will also intensify our engagement of the financial service charter signatory to help generate the necessary resource for the development of the smme sector our experience with regard to the development of this sector indicates that we must pay particular attention to issue of access to capital entrepreneurial training assistance with marketing and the development of cooperative far to contribute to the growth of the smme sector the government will reform it procurement programme to access some of it good and service from small and medium business ensure that it pay for what it purchase promptly we will also speed up the consultative process to determine the measure we must take to improve the regulatory climate to facilitate the expansion of this sector this intervention will form part of the overall programme to introduce a regulatory impact assessment system to enable the government regularly to ass the impact of it policy on economic activity in our country the year of freedom have be very good for business i believe that this should have convince the investor community by now that in it own interest and a part of the national effort it have to invest in the expansion of that freedom especially by actively and consciously contribute towards the achievement of the goal of halve poverty and unemployment by 2014 asgisa which build on the result of the growth and development summit offer this investor community an excellent opportunity to respond to this challenge in a deliberate and consistent manner in it own interest similarly and also a part of the national effort the trade union movement and civil society a a whole face the challenge to translate into action the commitment they make with the other social partner at the growth and development summit to a common vision for promote rise level of growth investment job creation and peoplecentred development asgisa provide a golden opportunity for the social partner to undertake the collaborative action they visualise at the gd focus on promote and mobilise investment and create decent work for all the impressive growth rate achieve by our economy in the current period have be driven in good measure by high consumer demand significantly finance through credit this have increase our import more than our export despite high commodity price the resultant balance of payment deficit have be finance by inflow of foreign capital through asgisa we will increase the significance of the supplyside driver of our growth a corollary of this be of course that we must ensure the international competitiveness of the good and service we produce this speaks directly to the common objective agree by the social partner at the growth and development summit to promote rise level of growth investment job creation and peoplecentred development i have already mention the fact that to meet our developmental objective which must respond to the high expectation of our people we will pay special attention to the critical task of strengthen local government our government considers this to be especially important at this stage of our evolution after the march 1st local government election all three sphere of government will therefore continue work together to ensure that each and every district and metro municipality be properly position to discharge it responsibility to the people in particular this will mean that each of these municipality have a realistic integrate development plan a credible local economic development programme and the material and human resource a well a the management and operational system to implement these idp and led integration of planning and implementation across the government sphere be therefore one of the prime area of focus in our programme for the next term of local government in this regard we will be guide by the intergovernmental relation framework act we must in practice respect the system of cooperative governance and within this context ensure that we empower local government to discharge it development and service delivery obligation draw on the lesson provide by project consolidate a many of u be aware by now project consolidate have identify serious capacity constraint in many of our municipality arise from a shortage of properly qualify manager professional and technical personnel we have take the necessary decision to attend to this urgent matter to improve the ability particularly of local government to meet the need of the people by march this year we shall have deployed 3 000 community development worker even a we implement the programme focus on accelerate and share growth with it important element of job creation we can not forget that the social wage play a vital role in our continue effort to address the challenge of poverty for instance 7 million child now receive the child support grant a total of 10 million of our citizen receive social grant real social expenditure per person increase by 60 between 1983 and 2003 detailed evidence from a study conduct by haroon bhorat prakash naidoo and

acid test of the legitimacy of the programme we elaborate the government institution we create the legislation we adopt must be whether they serve these objective our single most important challenge

manner that it guarantee the political and the human right of all our citizen a an affirmation of the government commitment to an entrench human right culture we shall immediately take step to inform the secretary general of the united nation that we will subscribe to the universal declaration of human right we shall take step to ensure that we accede to the international covenant on civil and political right the international covenant on social and economic right and other human right instrument of the united nation our definition of the freedom of the individual must be instruct by the fundamental objective to restore the human dignity of each and every south african this require that we speak not only of political freedom my government commitment to create a peoplecentred society of liberty bind u to the pursuit of the goal of freedom from want freedom from hunger freedom from deprivation freedom from ignorance freedom from suppression and freedom from fear these freedom be fundamental to the guarantee of human dignity they will therefore constitute part of the centrepiece of what this government will seek to achieve the focal point on which our attention will be continuously focus the thing we have say constitute the true meaning the justification and the purpose of the reconstruction and development programme without which it would lose all legitimacy when we elaborate this programme we be inspire by the hope that all south african of goodwill could join together to provide a well life for all we be pleased that other political organisation announce similar aim today i be happy to announce that the cabinet of the government of national unity have reach consensus not only on the broad objective of the creation of the peoplecentred society of which i have spoken but also on many element of a plan broadly base on that programme for reconstruction and development let me indicate some of the more important agreement annually in the combine budget of central government and the province we will provide for an increase amount of funding for the plan this will start with an appropriation of r25 billion in the 199495 budget that will be present next month this should rise to more than r10 billion by the fifth year of the life of this government government will also use it own allocation of fund to the reconstruction and development plan to exert maximum leverage in marshal fund from within south africa and abroad in this regard i be pleased to report that we have be hold consultation with some of the principal business leader of our country consequently we be assure that the business sector can and will make a significant contribution towards the structure and management of such reconstruction and development fund towards the

commitment to assist u to generate the reconstruction and development fund we need we thank them most sincerely for their positive attitude which arises not from objective of charity but from the desire to express solidarity with the new society we seek to build we accept the duty of coordinate the management of the total resource that will be generate without seek to prescribe to other contributor or undermine the continued role of nongovernmental organisation and communitybased organisation the initial r25 billion will be found from saving and the redirection of spending a include in the preliminary 199495 budget proposal present to cabinet i would like to thank the department of state for their cooperation in carry out this adjustment to their planning at short notice a we allocate large amount in future we shall require far adjustment by department partly to correct the bias in the spending pattern which be a legacy of the past the longer period shall allow such change to be properly plan but they will still make great demand on the managerial capacity and spirit of cooperation of the cabinet and the whole civil service we be confident that motivate by the desire to serve the people the public service will discharge it responsibility with diligence sensitivity and enthusiasm among other thing pay attention to the important goal of increase efficiency and

affair precisely because we be commit to ensure sustainable growth and development lead to a well life for all we will continue exist programme of fiscal rehabilitation we be therefore determine to make every effort to contain real general government consumption at present level and to manage the budget deficit with a view to it continuous reduction similarly we be agree that a permanently high general level of taxation be to be avoid to achieve these important objective will require consistent discipline on the part of both the central and the provincial government furthermore this discipline approach will ensure that we integrate the objective of our reconstruction and development plan within government expenditure and not treat them a incidental to the task of government marginalise to the status of mere addition to the level of expenditure there be major area of desperate need in our society a a signal of it seriousness to address these the government will within the

industry and deal with the critical issue of jobcreation we be bless with a heritage of a sophisticated financial sector our financial market be wellplaced to play an important part in the allocation of scarce fund to give effect to our economic development programme it be however also necessary that we think in new way to meet the challenge of reconstruction and development we therefore welcome recent development that provide for the creation of community bank we would also like to encourage the great participation of establish financial institution in the important area of black economic empowerment and support for the development of small and medium business the latter two area of economic activity will receive the great attention of the government because of their importance in deracialising and democratise the economy and create the job which our people need we pay attention to the important matter of consumer protection to shield the ordinary people of our country from unscrupulous business practice we must also clear that we must pay increase attention to tourism the job and foreign currency which tourism generates will strongly influence our economy the active and imaginative intervention of all stake stakeholder in this area of our national life must take advantage of the excellent atmosphere create by our peaceful transition to democracy to make tourism a major positive force in the future we look forward to the private sector a a whole play a central role in achieve the significantly high and sustainable rate of economic growth we be convince that the growth prospect of this sector will be enhance by the measure of fiscal discipline contain in our approach to the reconstruction and development programme and by the continued steady course of monetary policy a growth proceeds more domestic saving will progressively become available to finance increase investment at reasonable rate of interest the government be also acutely conscious of the fact that we should work firstly to return the capital account of the balance of payment to equilibrium and in due course to ensure a net inflow of resource consistent with the experience of other country that enjoy more rapid growth rate the present situation of a dual currency and the existence of an exchange control apparatus be a direct result of the conflict in which our country be embroil in the past a the situation return to normal these arrangement will be subject to critical scrutiny it should be possible to match the steady growth of confidence at home and abroad with other

the transnet group to continue the process of change represent by the acquisition of a valuable strategic partner by south african airway last year of especial importance will be our capacity to ensure that the cost structure of our transport network be consistent with the high and sustain growth rate we have to achieve consistent with the decision take at the job summit both the public and the private sector have commit the necessary fund for the promotion of the tourism sector commonly accepted a potentially one of the most important sector with regard to job creation the work have therefore begin vigorously to promote the growth of this sector we be certain this will produce the necessary beneficial result while we be at davos i receive a letter from professor nicholas conard and john parkington of the university of tubingen and cape town respectively they make the important observation that the archaeological record of south africa include human fossil artefact and organic remains have an international significance that extends far beyond the country border less well know be the hominid that demonstrate the early sign of modern people and the treasure trove of rock art site while correctly point to the need to protect this heritage to which we must surely respond they also indicate the potential for job creation in the preservation and other activity at the various archaeological site needle to say these can also be powerful tourist attraction thus emphasise the importance raise by the two professor with regard to the challenge of look after what we have inherit which be a old a the origin of humanity madame speaker and honourable membersas we have indicate would be do when we open the new parliament last june the government have carry out extensive and intensive work to elaborate an integrate and sustainable rural development programme the implementation of this programme will begin this year the strategic objective we will pursue will be to ensure that we achieve integrate and sustainable development in our rural area outside of and in addition to the commercial farm by the year 2010 we chose to focus on these area to reverse a centuryold legacy of white minority rule accord to which million of our people be confine in povertystricken area alternatively described a native reserve bantustans and homeland the honourable deputy president and leader of government business will provide the detail on this matter last june i make specific reference to our commitment to deal with the relationship between poverty and crime accordingly the government have be work to address the multifaceted crime and poverty challenge thrown up by the urban area we identify time will not allow u to detail the varied work that be be do in these area an opportunity will therefore have to be found in future to present that detailed report at this stage suffice it for me to say that these area of high population density will be at the centre of our urban renewal programme this be particularly important in the light of the fact that in reality the urban area contain the large concentration of poverty in our country madame speakeri would like to take this opportunity once more to emphasise the importance we attach to the strategic objective of building the partnership between the public and the private sector we will therefore far intensify our link and cooperation with the private sector for the successful implementation of the various economic initiative we have mention similarly we be very encourage by the response of our people a a whole that we should transform ourselves into a nation at work throughout the country from the wine farm in the western cape to rural community in the northern province the people be respond to this call by take the initiative to engage the challenge of productive economic activity the government will work far to encourage it partnership with the people for development which will help to lay to rest the false notion that the government have the exclusive responsibility to create job and therefore that everybody should wait for the government to create these job in this context we must warn very strongly that illegal and unjustified strike such a the one recently experienced at volkswagen in uitenhage can not be tolerate job a well life for our people in the context of a grow economy and our stand in the eye of the international investor community and the national investor community can not be held hostage by element pursue selfish and antisocial purpose accordingly the government have work with the management at volkswagen a well a numsa to ensure that the problem create by some irresponsible element at this plant be resolve the government will not waver from this position in this context i must also make this clear that the government be determine to carry out the programme for the renewal of our minibus taxi fleet a well a the introduction of other measure to ensure that this sector provide a safe dependable and discipline service to the public age minibus which be design a family vehicle can not be allow to roam our road condemn pay passenger to risk their life by travel in mobile coffin a some of our provincial government demonstrate when they close down taxi rank to deal with the continue problem of taxi violence and while we be ready to engage in genuine consultation it be a mistake to think that the government can be intimidate into take wrong decision here we would also like to make the point that low tax morality have lead to an increase in tax criminality the revenue service will therefore introduce new measure which will result in tough action against noncompliant tax payer who defraud the fiscus of million of rand through vat and custom fraud tax evasion or not register for tax at all tax criminality feed other form of criminality and will also not be tolerate madame speakerwe be certain that the combination of the various economic initiative and process we have mention include the continue implementation of all the commitment make at the job summit will take u far forward a we address the ever urgent question of economic growth development job creation and poverty reduction in this regard we must also mention our hope that the european union will overcome the problem that have arisen within it rank which have affected the unhindered implementation of the trade and development agreement which be conclude between ourselves and the eu similarly we continue to work hard to conclude the matter relate largely to the issue of rule of origin which have delayed the implementation of the sadc trade protocol we remain convince that this protocol will come into force during the first half of this year

economic relation with country of the south for the mutual benefit include nigeria saudi arabia brazil india malaysia and china a the honourable member be aware all these matter be of great importance to the success of our economy and will therefore receive the necessary attention also receive similar attention be the problem represent by the fact that we still have not remove the bottleneck which result in a slow disbursement of fund allocate for poverty relief the government have determine that this be unacceptable while recognise that it reflect the fact that we have not yet complete the work of the fundamental restructuring of our system of governance these poverty relief fund represent an important part of our social expenditure which continue to be focus on meeting the social need of the most disadvantage in our society the government will continue to allocate significant resource to address these need a best we can we will therefore continue with our programme to address such matter a pension and social welfare housing education and medical care at the same time we be work towards the creation of an integrate social security system far to improve the quality of our social spending and to enhance it positive impact on those in our society who be most in need it be however also clear that we need to strike the proper balance between such expenditure and more directly economic expenditure by the public sector to ensure that we address the challenge of growth and redistribution together this also be be attend to later this year at the begin of july our country will host the 13th international aid conference this will help far to focus our attention on this important challenge a we announce when we spoke at the ncop last year the honourable minister of health

would now like to speak on our priority for the year ahead political freedom alone be incomplete without economic emancipation oliver tambo spoke clearly about this mission at an sacp anniversary meeting in london in 1981 he saidthe objective of our struggle in south africa a set out in the freedom charter encompasses economic emancipation it be inconceivable for liberation to have meaning without a return of the wealth of the country to the people a a whole to allow the exist economic force to retain their interest intact be to feed the root of racial supremacy and exploitation and do not represent even the shadow of liberation it be therefore a fundamental feature of our strategy that victory must embrace more than formal political democracy and our drive towards national emancipation must include economic emancipation what do we mean by radical socioeconomic transformationwe mean fundamental change in the structure system institution and pattern of ownership management and control of the economy in favour of all south african especially the poor the majority of whom be african and female a define by the govern party which make policy for the democratic government twenty two year into our freedom and democracy the majority of black people be still economically disempowered they be dissatisfied with the economic gain from liberation the gap between the annual average household income of africanheaded household and their white counterpart remains shockingly huge white household earn at least five time more than black household accord to statistic sa the situation with regard to the ownership of the economy also mirror that of household income only ten percent of the top one hundred company on the johannesburg stock exchange be own by black south african directlyachieved principally through the black empowerment code accord to the national empowerment fund the pace of transformation in the workplace the implementation of affirmative action policy a require by the employment equity act also remains very slow in term of the 201516 information submit to the employment equity commission the representation of white at top management level amount to 72 percent whilst african representation be at 10 percent the representation of coloureds stood at 4 5 and indian 8 7 the report far provide that white south african in particular male be afford high level of recruitment promotion and training opportunity a compare to the designate group at the level of gender at senior management level male remain dominant at 67 6 and female at 32 4 percent the skewed nature of ownership and leadership pattern need to be correct there can be no sustainability in any economy if the majority be exclude in this manner in my discussion with the business community they accepted these transformation imperative today we be start a new chapter of radical socioeconomic transformation we be say that we should move beyond word to practical programme the state will play a role in the economy to drive that transformation in this regard government will utilise to the maximum the strategic lever that be available to the state this include legislation regulation licensing budget and procurement a well a broadbased black economic empowerment charter to influence the behaviour of the private sector and drive transformation the state spends five hundred billion rand a year buying good and service add to this be the nine hundred billion rand infrastructure budget those budget must be use to achieve economic transformation a a start the new regulation make it compulsory for big contractor to subcontract 30 percent of business to black own enterprise have be finalise and be gazette on the 20th of january through such regulation and programme government will be able to use the state buying power to empower small enterprise rural and township enterprise designate group and to promote local industrial development two key challenge we face be the high level of concentration in the economy a well a the collusion and cartel which squeeze out small player and hamper the entry of young entrepreneur and black industrialist the competition authority have do excellent work to uncover the cartel and punish them for break the law last year i sign into law a provision to criminalize the cartel and collusion and it come into effect on 1 may it carry jail sentence of up to 10 year we be now step up our action to deal with the other challenge namely economic concentration where a small group control most of a market during this year the department of economic development will bring legislation to cabinet that will seek to amend the competition act it will among others address the need to have a more inclusive economy and to deconcentrate the high level of ownership and control we see in many sector we will then table the legislation for consideration by parliament in this way we seek to open up the economy to new player give black south african opportunity in the economy and indeed help to make the economy more dynamic competitive and inclusive this be our vision of radical economic transformation

africa define by a common dream to say together in action enough of everything that make our country to contain within it and represent much that be ugly and repulsive in human societywe must continue to respond to the perspective we spoke of a the present government begin it term of office fully conscious that none of the great social problem we have to solve be capable of resolution outside the

responsibility a a critical player in the growth reconstruction and development of our country to accelerate the process of renewal of the african continent and increasingly to contribute to the resolution of major question face people of the world madame speaker and chairpersoni be happy to report that with regard to each of these commitment government remains hard at work to ensure that the nation objective be met at an average of over 45 the rate of growth of our economy over the past two and half year have be at it high since we attain our democracy in 1994 investment in the economy by both the public and private sector have be increase at about 11 with overall public sector infrastructure spending increase by an annual average of 158 today fix investment a a percentage of gross domestic product at about 184 be at it high since 1991 the number of employ people have be increase at about halfamillion a year in the past three year we have see steady progress in the advancement of black people in the economy from own just over 3 of the market capitalisation of the jse in 2004 this have increase to close on to 5 and the proportion of black in top management have grown from 24 of the total to 27 yet we must remain concerned that these figure be still woefully low the advance in the economy have thrown up major challenge for all of u the massive and sustain increase in consumer demand reflect a healthy growth in level of prosperity across the population and the major infrastructure project that we be embark on demand massive input of supply and machinery but our international trade balance show that we have not succeed in building the capacity to produce the consumer and capital good that our country need while household debt have increase broadly at the same rate a growth in income the fact that south african be save less mean that we have to depend on saving from other nation the continue occasional volatility of our currency have also not bode well for our export industry over the past three year the economy have create some oneandhalf million job it be encourage that in the year march 2005 to march 2006 alone 300 000 of the job create be in the formal sector outside of agriculture represent a growth rate of about 4 a small part of these be the permanent job opportunity create through the expand public work programme but there be no question that this programme can and must be ratchet upwards quite significantly there be also no question that we can do much well to create selfemployment through small and microenterprises and give that a large majority of the unemployed be youth we can do much well in term of such intervention a the national youth service and the development of young entrepreneur it be a matter of pride that in line with our commitment to build a care society we have since 2004 improve service provision and other aspect of the social wage while beneficiary of social grant numbered about 8 million in 2004 today 11 million poor south african have access to these grant it be encourage that the rate of increase in uptake have in the recent period be within manageable range a the programme reach maturity this will ensure sustainability and employment of more government resource to provide economic service to create more job and business opportunity the housing programme have see close to 300 000 new subsidy allocate in the past two year however a we sought to improve quality and develop plan for those who be be miss by the public and private sector programme currently under way the pace of rollout have be much slow than we expect we must act to change this situation a honourable member be aware we have over the past few year developed and start implement various programme aim at improve passenger transport these include the taxi recapitalisation programme and provincial initiative such a the moloto rail corridor in mpumalanga around which feasibility work have start the klipfontein corridor in cape town and the gautrain project with it linkage to the rest of the public transport system these and many other initiative form part of a comprehensive passenger transport strategy combine both road and rail we will attend to the urgent implementation of these programme to improve the quality of life of especially the work people access to electricity water and sanitation have improve by 2005 south africa have already achieve the millennium development goal in respect of basic water supply with improvement of access from 59 in 1994 to 83 in 2006 accord to the united nation development programme undp south africa be one of the few country that spend less on military budget than on water and sanitation in the word of the undp human development report of 2006 south africa have demonstrate how the human right to water can serve a a mechanism for empowerment and a guide to policy rightsbased water reform have enable it to expand access and overcome the legacy of racial inequality inherit from apartheid partly through rightsbased entitlement pp6263we should indeed celebrate this great achievement but it be a fact that 8 million people be still without potable water many more be without electricity and sanitation we be proud that within one year we have be able to reduce the backlog in the eradication of the bucket system in establish settlement by almost half we be on course to put an end to this dehumanise system in these area by the end of this year we will continue to confront these challenge so a to erase in our country that which be ugly and repulsive so that together we can speak of freedom and the happiness that come with liberty an examination of education and skill acquisition show improvement of quite a high base by 2004 though at a slow pace this applies to literacy level gross school enrolment and tertiary participation rate the fluctuate matric pas rate do indicate that much more need to be do to stabilise the system and ensure steady improvement at the same time the number of matric student who pas mathematics at the high grade be only slightly well than in 1995 we also continue to show weakness in implement the adult basic education programme while the land restitution programme have result in more settlement in the recent period we still need to put in extra effort in deal with remain case many of which be much more complex on the other hand very little progress have be make in term of land redistribution we will undertake a careful review of the inhibit factor so that this programme be urgently speed up all these economic and social programme form part of our strategy to reduce and eradicate the poverty that continue to afflict many of our people the work do during the course of last year by woman through the south african woman in dialogue work with various government department include a visit to country such a tunisia and chile where great progress have be make in deal with poverty do point to some defect in our system in this regard from the experience of this delegation it be clear that we must among other thing define clearly the poverty matrix of our country develop a proper database of household living in poverty identify and implement specific intervention relevant to these household monitor progress in these household a the programme take effect in graduate them out of poverty in this context address all indigence especially the high number of woman so affected coordinate and align all antipoverty programme to maximise impact and avoid wastage and duplication and accelerate the training of family social worker at professional and auxiliary level to ensure that identify household be properly support and monitor this will ensure the systematic linkage of beneficiary of social assistance to municipal service and work opportunity continuously focus on the task to ensure that a many of our people a possible graduate out of dependence on social grant and enter the labour market in the meantime we will continue to explore new initiative which will progressively improve the social wage a critical leg of these social intervention should be the intensification of joint effort among all south african to improve social cohesion in this year of the 60th anniversary of the doctor pact of leader of african and indian community ab xuma gm naicker and yusuf dadoo the 30th anniversary of the murder of steve biko and the 20th anniversary of the visit to dakar by afrikaner intellectual to meet the anc the issue of our variety of identity and the overarch sense of belonging to south africa need to be well canvass across society in a manner that strengthens our unity a a nation far on this the 30th anniversary of the ban of the world and the weekend world newspaper we be dutybound to ask the question have we all fully internalise our responsibility in building social cohesion and promote a common sense of belonging reinforce the glue that hold our nation togetherin other word measure require to improve social cohesion can not be undertaken by government alone we must together a south african speak of freedom from want and from moral decay and work to attain the happiness that come with it madame speaker and chairpersoni be certain that we shall all agree that work together to achieve the happiness that come with freedom applies equally to the challenge of deal with crime in the 1994 rdp white paper we saidpromoting peace and security will involve all people it will build on and expand the national drive for peace and combat the endemic violence face by communitieswith special attention to the various form of violence to which woman be subjectedpeace and political stability be also central to the government effort to create an enable environment to encourage investmentdecisive action will be take to eradicate lawlessness drug traffic gun run crime and especially the abuse of woman and child certainly we can not erase that which be ugly and repulsive and claim the happiness that come with freedom if community live in fear closet behind wall and barbed wire ever anxious in their house on the street and on our road unable freely to enjoy our public space obviously we must continue and far intensify the struggle against crime while we have already surpass that target figure of 152 000 police officer employ in the south african police service and while we have improve the training programme we recognise the fact that the impact of this be not yet high enough for everybody to feel a well sense of safety and security while we have reduce the incidence of most contact crime the annual reduction rate with regard to such category a robbery assault and murder be still below the 710 that we have target and the abuse of woman and child continue at an unacceptable level the increase in the incidence of particular crime during the security worker strike should have brought home to all of u the fact that the security industry can not be handle simply a a private affair of the private sector quite clearly the regulatory system that we have in place be inadequate this applies to such issue a wage level personnel vet system enforcement of guideline on cashdelivery vehicle and so on this be a matter that we shall review during the course of the year so that in addition to improve the work of the police we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security expectation of the public in which huge resource be expend be actually met we will also continue to put more effort into improve the function of our court to increase the rate of reduction in case backlog and we will ensure that decision to expand the correctional service infrastructure improve the management of border control a well a the immigration and documentation service among others be implement many of the weakness in improve service to the population derive in part from inadequate capacity and system to monitor implementation a such in the period lead up to 2009 the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our agenda what have emerge among others a a critical area for strategic intervention be the content of training that public servant receive in various institution and the role of the sa management development institute samdi which in actual fact should be the major service provider include in the mass induction of public servant compliance level within department in relation to public service and finance management legislation have be somewhat mixed obviously this can not be allow to continue even if we take into account the correct observation that audit requirement at national and provincial level have become more stringent in this regard the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management be crucial programme to improve the capacity of our local government system continue apace immediately after the march 2006 local government election induction programme be conduct take into account that 62 of the mayor be new what be of concern though be that in many of these municipality many vacancy remain or

national coordinate ministry success in this work should have a positive impact on such area a job creation crime and violence health and the general quality of life of million of our people who lead desperate life though it take longer than we thought in fact to elaborate realistic and integrate government plan the individual department and sphere of government have continued with their own programme focus on these twomatters of rural development and urban renewal for example investment total more than r3 billion have be make through the consolidated municipal infrastructure programme over the last three year with 47 per cent spent in rural area and 53 per cent in the urban area the work that will help u to move to a high phase with regard to rural development have now be conclude

programme the area identify include khayelitsha and mitchell plain in the western cape kwamashu and inanda in kwazulunatal mdantsane and motherwell in the eastern cape alexandra township in gauteng and galeshewe in the northern cape with regard to these area we will only be able to act immediately with regard to alexandra township and kwamashu work be go on to bring in the other area a soon a possible begin from this year of the start of centenary celebration in alexandra township r13 billion spread over seven year will be set aside to embark on an integrate development programme that will deliver housing road water sanitation school clinic magistrate office and police station again i would like to emphasise that this do not mean that no work be be do in other area what we be address here be the elaboration and implementation of the urban renewal programme bring together all three sphere of government a we have already indicate the success of these plan will also depend on the extent to which the people can be mobilise so that they become active participant in the process target at the upliftment of their own community we therefore repeat the call that we must all unite in action for change the social sector also have it own target programme of action focus on the social upliftment of especially the most disadvantage in our society it will implement coordinate programme in the nodal rural and urban area we have identify which among other thing will address such issue a housing water sanitation health include hivaids pension payouts household food security and nutrition poverty alleviation include the provision of certain amount of free service home affair service education and training sport and culture naturally this do not mean that other area of the country will be neglect the sector will also focus on the complete transfer to their occupant of a many municipal house a possible of the remain 350 000 property special attention will be paid to a more vigorous extension of the system of sanitation to contain the outbreak of waterborne disease in addition to the continue campaign against aid a more comprehensive approach to the health challenge in our country will be adopt to ensure an effective response to all infectious disease include malaria tuberculosis std cholera and hepatitis similarly a already indicate in term of some of the programme we have already mention we have to respond more decisively to other disease of poverty such a those that be cause by vitamin protein and energy deficiency work will be complete on a comprehensive social security system to try to extend the safety net to a many people a possible bearing in mind the resource constraint we face and the need to ensure that we do not impact negatively on economic spending we must again call on all our people to participate in the implementation of these programme in the spirit of masakhane the government will continue to pay the necessary attention to the issue of crime we be very conscious of the fact that the safety and security of all our citizen be a fundamental right and a critical element in our continue effort to improve the quality of life of all our people we want to arrive at the situation where all those who commit crime will know that they have nowhere to hide the priority area of focus with regard to the crime prevention and combat strategy will remain high crime area organise crime include urban terrorism crime against woman and child corruption cross border crime and social crime prevention a we have already indicate the area chosen a the lead point in our urban renewal programme will also be particular point of focus for our criminal justice system the 124 priority police station that we have identify in the past

service will give all require assistance to the metropolitan council to enable them to establish their municipal police service where these do not exist the national directorate of public prosecution and our court will also continue with the measure they have already adopt to reduce and eliminate the unduly large backlog of case that have not be try similarly work will continue to find a solution to the problem of overcrowd in our prison cause especially by the large number of awaitingtrial prisoner the criminal justice system will also far intensify it offensive against corruption among it own personnel this will include the introduction of a new leadership at correctional service an increase in intelligence resource dedicate to the fight against corruption and where necessary the expansion of the exist anticorruption unit last july the minister of safety and security place a moratorium on the use within the police service and the release of crime statistic this be because of serious problem about the integrity and reliability of these statistic which among other thing make it very difficult to design accurate and optimal operational plan in the fight against crime the point need to be understood that perhaps more than anybody else the ministry and the police service constantly need accurate and uptodate information on the incidence of crime to ensure proper deployment of human and material resource accordingly extensive work have be and be be carry out to ensure the availability of this information this have include and will include the training of over 3000 people and the recruitment of about 600 people tospecialise on the issue of crime information at this moment it be expect that the moratorium will end at the end of june the criminal justice cluster will also intensify it effort to encourage far community involvement in the fight against crime and corruption this will include the recruitment of 30 000 reservist especially in the already identify highcrime area once more this emphasis the importance of popular involvement in the common effort to change our country for the well the challenge of ensure the effectiveness and efficiency

institution such a the nda and the idt be commit madam speaker the rural area of our country represent the bad concentration of poverty no progress can be make towards a life of human dignity for our people a a whole unless we ensure the development of these area the government be now in a position to implement a rural development programme for the integrate development of the rural area this will bring together all government department and all sphere of government include the traditional leader the integration we seek must for instance ensure that when a clinic be built there must be a road to access it it must be electrify and supply with water it must have the requisite personnel qualify to meet the health need of the particular community the safety and security of the personnel and material resource which be part of the clinic must be guaranteed we must also establish the condition which give the possibility to this medical point to radiate outwards a a point of reference with regard to the large project of our selfdefinition a a people at work building a well life for ourselves consistent with our concentration on this objective include the critical importance of job the government remains preoccupy with the issue of gold sale and their impact on gold mining employment and export earnings both in our own country and the rest of our continent work within the gold crisis committee we will continue to maintain contact will all relevant player both domestically and throughout the world to minimise the inevitable adverse effect on our country our people and our continent the debt burden of those who can not both carry this debt and achieve sustain development must be address in the same way that we have demonstrate our own commitment to contribute to the development of others less fortunate than ourselves by forgive the debt of some of our neighbour we expect that those who be a thousand time wealthier than we be will not seek to help u a african by render u less capable of stand on our own foot far to improve the quality of life of all our people especially the most disadvantage the government will maintain it approach to reprioritise public spending to maintain and improve the safety net available to the most disadvantage in our society it be however vital that we improve the quality of spending in these area and therefore the delivery of service to the people this will be do by manage downwards the amount spent on personnel root out corruption and theft improve management skill throughout the social sector and ensure an integrate interdepartmental approach to the delivery of service special programme will also be introduce to speed up the improvement of the quality of life of various section of our population these will include the accelerate delivery of assistive device for the disabled and the establishment of onestop centre for abuse woman and child the office on the status of woman will present a gender audit to

enable u to take such decision a may be necessary to ensure that we continue to focus on the vital question of the development and emancipation of woman a well a far integrate this issue within all government programme the advance make in this national parliament and the national executive with regard to gender equity point to the need to adopt a similar approach with regard to all other centre of authority and power in our society similarly the government will tighten it track of the poverty question to ensure that government policy and programme be actually succeed to reduce the level of poverty in our country the fund set aside for poverty alleviation will also be allocate without far delay and will be use not a handout but a a catalyst towards sustainable development the government will also review all the work do so far to confront the scourge of hivaids with a view to the intensification of all effort relate to this epidemic of critical importance will be that we take all necessary step to ensure that the partnership against hivaids that have be form and the public education campaign we have be conduct do actually result in change behaviour pattern improve support to aid victim and orphan and speed up step towards the development of a vaccine an historic document of the people of our country asserts that a a consequence of the victory of the struggle for national liberation the door of education and learn shall be open to allmany people include our youth die and sacrifice for the realisation of this objective they do so because they understood the importance for themselves and all our community of the right to freedom from ignorance consistent with this correct view we must ensure that education and training constitute the decisive driver in our effort to build a win nation the government will therefore intensify it focus on education so that we succeed in our effort to produce an educate and appropriately skilled population a great deal of work have be do in this area affect all level of education and training we will therefore ensure that exist policy and programme be carry out with a sense of urgency and commitment to their success to achieve

to the people we will also work with the south african local government association to lend all necessary assistance to ensure that this sphere of government improves it effectiveness and efficiency bearing in mind that this be the point at which our entire system of government delivers service to the people in this context we must make the point that to overcome the problem of urban poverty will require that local government adopts and pursues a consistent programme of poverty relief without discrimination on the basis of race or colour our government be ready and willing to support this effort the promotion and protection of the cultural linguistic and religious right of all our people must occupy a central place in the work of government it should not happen that anyone of u should feel a sense of alienation whatever the sickness of our society none should be driven to level of despair which drive them to a peripheral existence at the fringe of the mainstream nor should we allow that those who be deny their identity include the khoi and the san continue to exist in the shadow a passing historical relic and an object of an obscene tourist curiosity we consider the work of restore the pride and identity of all our people of vital importance to the task of advance the human dignity of all our citizen and ensure the success of our effort towards national reconciliation

rich tapestry that constitutes our diverse be a a people this will be an important contribution to the effort we must sustain to wipe out the legacy of racism and sexism which continue to afflict our society capacity will be create within the presidency to ensure that our government at it high level give attention to all these question which bear on nation building the government will also focus on the task of achieve the objective of the african renaissance and ensure that the next century evolves a the african century we will therefore contribute whatever we can towards the resolution of conflict on our continent we can not accept that war violent conflict and rapine be a permanent condition of existence for u a african nor can we accept that our continent endow with enormous human and natural resource be incapable of achieve sustain development everyday all those who will hear and see be expose to the extraordinary integrate cultural heritage which both capture our african past and be an important factor that will contribute towards the recovery of our pride and dignity gradually africa will work her way towards the resumption of her rightful place among the continent of our globe where necessary we will call on the service of such outstanding african statespersons a former president mwalimu julius nyerere sir ketumile masire and nelson mandela to assist in the promotion of this agenda a part of the world community of nation we will make our due contribution to the construction of a new world order that will be responsive to the need of especially the poor of the world for u to succeed in our work both a a government and a a people will require that we approach the task ahead with all due seriousness and a sense of discipline which recognises the fact that all

the preside officer the whip the chairperson of committee the secretary of parliament and his staff for the sterling work that be do from the day that this first democratic and nonracial parliament convene of necessity much of this work have to do with the establishment of our organisation structure and evolve a rhythm of work which would enable u to discharge our responsibility in an effective and efficient manner all of u precisely because we have never sat in any democratic parliament before have to begin the continue process of learn how to carry out our function a people deputy we have to educate ourselves in an atmosphere characterise by a critical public focus which do not necessarily allow for the reality of that inexperience undoubtedly many of u both in the legislature and in the executive have make mistake but mistake be an inevitable element of any process of learn it be always the case that the spectator be well than the player on the field none of u should therefore feel ashamed for have commit error we must however learn from these mistake so that we do indeed improve our performance whatever it be that our critic might have to say we can take pride in the fact that not only do we succeed to establish our two house of parliament a require by the constitution but we also ensure that they play their role in the government of our country we be pleased that the honourable member of both the national assembly and the senate have not be satisfied merely to endorse the bill that have be present to them but have participate actively in improve such draft legislation with the aim of ensure that our law be consistent with the glorious vision we share of create a truly humane and peoplecentred society of particular importance be the fact that you the legislator have work in a manner consistent with the objective of ensure that ours should be a parliament of the people this we have do by opening our proceeding to the public to ensure that the people know what we be do and by opening the door to the people to address the legislative committee of parliament directly this have also be replicate in our provincial legislature consistent with our objective of bring government a close to the people a possible we can therefore claim with justification that such legislate a have be approve be representative of the will of the people and therefore enjoys a degree of legitimacy and enforceability which all previous law could never have undoubtedly we must continue to look for way and mean of ensure that the people a a whole be well inform of what we be do and be give ever improve capacity to intervene in our proceeding in an inform and purposive manner in the recent past much have be say about corruption among some member of this parliament and other lead political figure in the country many within and without this chamber and among the mass medium have be very keen to condemn and to propel u into precipitate action on the basis of mere allegation we have resist this and will continue to do so we have a responsibility to act on the basis of fact and not allegation however strident the voice that make those allegation furthermore we firmly believe that it be important that we build a society on justice and fairness at all time we must guarantee the right of the accuse to be heard without make any concession to a primeval instinct to pillory and burn people at the stake a south african with our particular history we must be extremely careful not to reintroduce the mccarthyism atmosphere which result in people be herd into unthinking horde that sought the blood of anybody who be label a communist we must also make this clear that we need no educator with regard to the matter of root out corruption which we will deal with firmly and unequivocally whoever may be involve we be conscious of the reality that corruption in many form have deeply infect the fibre of our society it be not possible to have a society base on a lie and patent injustice a apartheid society be without this spawn corrupt practice precisely because we face the challenge of deal with systematic corruption we need a dispassionate and systematic approach to this question and not allow ourselves to be stampede by response which be not very different from a witchhunt to address another important matter of the day later this year we will be hold our local government election to complete the process of establish the democratic structure which we need to ensure that the people be able to take their destiny into their own hand the importance of these popularly elect structure at the local level can not be overestimate it be at this level that we must deliver change it be at this level that the people can most directly participate in make decision about important matter that affect their daily life it be also at this level that we must confront the division create by the system of apartheid and grapple with the problem that arise out of the racial and territorial maldistribution of resource and infrastructure that be impose on the country by this system in reality it be impossible to enter this next and critical stage of the dismantle of the system of apartheid until we have democratically elect structure of government which enjoy a popular mandate to bring about the nonracial nonsexist and democratic society demand of u by the constitution i would therefore like to take this opportunity to call on all our people in their million to take the forthcoming local government election very seriously the immediate task that we must all fulfil be to register a voter i appeal to all political party both those represent in our national and provincial legislature and those outside of these structure to do everything in their power to mobilise the people to register a voter this appeal also extends to all other people organisation and institution of civil society to use their influence or organise the people to register for an participate in the local government election it be also the obligation of all political organisation that will participate in the local government election to ensure that we experience no violence or intimidation during the conduct of our election campaign it would also like to take advantage of this occasion to make it very clear to the country a a whole that the government will not allow anybody to obstruct the process of the registration of voter regardless of the social status of the person concerned it be important to bear in mind that unlike our election of last year these election will be conduct with democratically elect national and provincial government in place these government will not hesitate to use all legitimate force at their disposal to ensure that nobody stand in the way of the people to express their will freely i be also pleased to report that whatever the teethe problem the concept and vision of a government of national unity have prove it correctness and viability it have succeed in it intention of ensure cooperation among our people a a whole the development of a national consensus around a whole range of important matter enable important minority party to have a real voice in the government of the country and contribute to peace stability and confidence in the future of our country at the national level we continue to work together in a nonconfrontational atmosphere far to elaborate rule convention and procedure to ensure that the government of national unity function effectively and be able to address in a balance way the fact of different party with different policy and the tension between the democratic right of the majority party and the effective participation of the minority party in this regard i should mention that we have agree with the provincial premier that we will share our view on these matter with them and their administration to evolve common practice conducive to good governance happily all the major party have commit themselves to the perspective contain in the commonlyevolved reconstruction and development programme this constitutes the firm basis for the continue cooperation among the various party inside and outside the government of national unity without which such cooperation would become impossible we must however also make this point that when all be say and do a individual and a party we belong to the same government we therefore have a collective responsibility both to participate in the formulation of policy and the elaboration of decision and to defend take responsibility for and implement those decision in the period ahead of u we shall therefore insist on the collective responsibility and accountability of everybody concerned a part of a process in which we must all engage of raise the level of discipline and responsible action throughout the society a few day ago we be honour to participate in the move and historic opening of our constitutional court this be yet another giant step in the transformation of our judicial system and the building of a lawgoverned society which will protect the fundamental human right of all our citizen and ensure that the people be not threaten by arbitrary and oppressive rule the process of the transformation of the judiciary will continue among other thing to ensure that it be representative of our society and to enable even the poor to have the ability to obtain legal redress where need arises all necessary step will also be take to ensure that the judicial system play it proper role with regard to the important matter of reduce the level of crime in our society and address the legitimate concern of the public that we do not create the situation in which the people begin to feel that criminal and wrongdoer be be favour while the interest of society be be ignore far progress will also be make this year to establish other institution that be critical to the construction of the peoplecentred society to which we be all committedamong these will be the human right commission the public protector the gender and youth commission the inspector general of intelligence and the structure that will be create by the pending open democracy or freedom of information act we be determine to move with all due speed to create and strengthen all the institution of governance that we have spoken of to deal with the matter of effective and open government once more we must address a few word to our public service without whose dedicate service to the people effective government and public delivery to the population will be impossible we be commit to the motivation of all public sector worker so that they become a conscious willing and skilled agent for the transformation of our society accord to the objective spelt out in the reconstruction and development programme a part of this process cabinet have give instruction to all minister to interact continuously with all member of their ministry and department to brief them about their task to report on progress achieve to agree on how to overcome obstacle to the process of transformation and generally to be involve in the struggle for change we have also invite the public sector union to participate a fully a possible in the budgeting process so that they make their own contribution to the difficult task of decide the best possible allocation of the limited resource available to government we be convince that an adversarial relationship between the executive and the administration would impact negatively on the common task which these two institution share of serve the people of south africa such an outcome must be avoid at all cost accordingly we have be available and willing to address all matter of concern to the public service worker include question of salary promotion pension and other issue relevant to work condition it be however also important that the public service should be willing to join hand with the government to address other important matter such a the racial and gender imbalance within the public service the public service will never be fully acceptable to the people a a whole and can never be truly responsive to the need of the people unless it be compose in all it rank in a manner that reflect the composition of our population to speed up this process the government will continue to implement measure and programme aim at ensure that those who be disadvantage by apartheid in the past be give the capacity to catch up with those who be give the possibility to develop and advance themselves in term of management and other skill this be what we mean when we talk of affirmative action programme we speak of a human resource development programme which will ensure that all our people and not merely some be give the possibility to develop their talent and to contribute to the reconstruction and development of society to the best of their ability i therefore call on all our people to refuse to listen to the false prophet who seek to perpetuate the apartheid division and imbalance of the past by present affirmative action a a programme intend to advantage some and disadvantage others on the basis of race and colour it be also appropriate that on this occasion we draw the attention of the country to the actual reality that the government have extremely limited resource to address the many and urgent need of our people we be very keen that this real situation should be communicate to the people a a whole all of u especially the leadership of political organisation and civil society must rid ourselves of the wrong notion that the government have a big bag full of money the government do not have such rich because we have start the process of change spending priority we do realise that the process of restructuring the budget so that it be direct towards address the need of the people be no easy matter this be especially so in the light of the contractual obligation that bind the state a well a carry over expenditure which can not be avoid we must all absorb this reality into our think in a cold and dispassionate manner and not allow ourselves to be seduce into a world of false hope lead to unrealistic action base on the wrong assumption that the government can be coerce to meet demand that it can not meet however justified and legitimate these demand might be it be important that we rid ourselves of the culture of entitlement which lead to the expectation that the government must promptly deliver whatever it be that we demand and result in some people refuse to meet their obligation such a rent and service payment or engage in other unacceptable action such a the forcible occupation of house a we have say with regard to the public sector union we seek to ensure that the budgeting process be a transparent and a participatory a possible it be the right of the people to know how much money they have contribute to the finance of the state and how that money be be use it be their right also not only to know but also to contribute their view a to how public fund should be disburse that be why such body a the parliamentary committee and the national economic forum have be brought into the budgeting process tomorrow we shall be launch a very important body the national economic development and labour council nedlac this crucial body will bring together representative of government labour capital and civil society this will be one of the institution on which we will relay in term of decision that we must arrive at with regard to the use of public fund and asset we trust that the representative that sit of nedlac will in turn reach out to their own constituency to inform and involve them in the process of arrive at decision which bear among other thing on the disbursement of public fund what we have say constitutes a firm undertaking on the part of government to ensure a participatory process with regard to the public finance bearing this in mind we believe that government have a right to expect that the public at large should behave in a responsible manner when it address the question of the obligation of government to meet the material expectation of the people i would like to address this matter bluntly the strike action which have be threaten by a few of the public sector union will not succeed to force the government to make available money for large wage and salary increase i say this be fully aware and sympathetic to the plight of many public sector worker who be indeed poorly paid i say it precisely because i be aware of the reality that for no fault of it own the government literally do not have the money to meet the demand that be be advanced mass action of any kind will not create resource that the government do not have and would only serve to subvert the capacity of government to serve the people i would like to repeat that the government be commit to enter into a comprehensive threeyear agreement with the public sector union to address all matter of mutual interest include improve packet particularly for the lowestpaid public sector worker in this regard i would like to extend our sincere appreciation to the leader and the majority of the public sector union which have engage with u in a constructive manner which be sensitive to the need of the country a a whole we be ready to work together with these union to solve the problem which face u together for the benefit of the worker and society a a whole i must also address the question of the attempt by some in our country to introduce anarchy into our society i speak of those who engage in such totally unacceptable practice a the murder of police officer the take of hostage riot loot the forcible occupation of public building block of public highway vandalisation of public and private property and so on some of those who have initiate and participate in such activity have misread freedom to mean license they have misinterpret popular participation to mean their ability to impose chaos on society they have wrongly conclude that an elect government of the people be a government that be open to compulsion through act of anarchy let me therefore make this abundantly clear that the small minority in our midst which wear the mask of anarchy will meet it match in the government we lead and the mass of the people who put that government into office this they must know that we be not afraid of struggle we be after all a product of confrontation and struggle in the past we be not defeat by force more powerful than they in this instance we will not be defeat by those whose action have nothing to do with defend or advance the cause of the people we be certain that the democratic trade union movement will also join hand with u to isolate and defeat the minority which seek to discredit the trade union movement by engage in violent activity during the course of strike action let be therefore be clear to all that the battle against the force of anarchy and chaos have be join let no one say they have not be warn in the same vein we must address the question of crime the situation can not be tolerate in which our country continue to be engulfed by the crime wave which include murder crime against woman and child drug traffic arm robbery fraud and theft we must take the war to the criminal and no longer allow the situation in which we be mere sit duck of those in our society who for whatever reason be bent to engage in criminal and antisocial activity instruction have therefore already go out to the minister of safety and security the national commissioner of the police service and the security organ a a whole to take all necessary measure to bring down the level of crime i would also like to take this opportunity to emphasise that the matter of our safety and security be not one that should be left only to the law enforcement organ for them to succeed they need the full and active support of all our community the policecommunity forum that have be establish be extremely important with regard to reinforce cooperation between the police and the public and therefore increase the capacity of the country a a whole to deal with the common problem of crime i would therefore like to urge the formation of such forum where they do not exist and the involvement of all opinion maker in all locality in the process which be aim at enhance the people safety and security the government be determine to do everything in it power to move speedily towards the formation of the new police service we be very interested to address the matter of the earnings and work condition of all member of the police service and to give this service the necessary mean to enable it do discharge it responsibility a effectively a possible in this regard we must also make it clear that the government be oppose to and have no intention to conduct a witchhunt against the police a a result of activity arise from order give to o the police by the apartheid regime we therefore urge every member of the police service to get down to the urgent and press matter of enhance the safety and security of the people a a whole when we open parliament last year we address the issue of racism in the workplace and in our society at large we continue to be confront by this problem people have continued to die a a result of the continue practice of racism the late be a victim of racist resistance to the use of a former white school by lack child those who be responsible for these crime of racism must be brought to book without delay it be clear that insufficient progress have be make in many workplace and elsewhere in our society to deal with this cancer we trust that the human right commission will help u to deal with this matter firmly and continuously by encourage the public to report all instance of racism so that these can be brought to light the government have discuss this matter and be commit to carry out it constitutional obligation of transform our country into a nonracial society the situation can not be allow in which anyone act in a manner which perpetuates the practice of apartheid both the government and the people a a whole share a common obligation to live up to the very purpose of the struggle that million of people wag of end racism in our country and ensure the equality of all our people one of the most sensitive matter we must address this year be the establishment of the truth and reconciliation commission we must move towards this a speedily a possible so a to remove all the uncertainty that have be create through the protract discussion of this issue the legislature be currently discuss the bill deal with this matter and be receive public submission i would like to urge that we achieve speedy progress in this regard i would also like to draw the attention of the legislature and the country a a whole that our purpose in establish the truth and reconciliation commission be both to obtain the truth and to reinforce the process of reconciliation which our country need nothing we do should lead to the heighten of tension and the rekindle of the violent political conflict which we have succeed so well to bring under reasonable control this must also be borne in mind that many of u who suffer quite significantly a a result of apartheid repression be make no demand which would result in vengeance against or persecution of those who might have harm u or those close to u urgent step be also require to end the continue political violence in the province of kwazulunatal this be both a lawenforcement issue and a matter for the political party and leader in the province to address if we claim to be genuine leader of our people it must surely be one of our principle task to end the kill both to save life and to create the climate of peace and stability which we need to develop the province which be among the poorest area in the country progress have be make with regard to the basic challenge of building a well life for all our people some of the project which we announce last year include the feed of school child and the provision of free health service to certain section of our population have be implement it be necessary that we draw the necessary lesson from our experience in this effort to meet the basic need of the people one of these a we have state already be that the government have very limited resource to address the multiple and urgent need of our people it be therefore critical that we determine a proper set of priority on which we should focus to effect a visible and sustainable improvement in the life of the people it be also important that we implement any project in this regard not in an adhoc manner but within the context of 5year and other medium and longterm plan and projection the cabinet have discuss this matter and decide on our priority which will include rural and urban development human resource development job creation and health detailed interdepartmental work be now go on to elaborate plan reflect this focus to ensure that the government us in a rational and effective manner the limited resource at it disposal in this regard government will not make any commitment which it can not meet on a continuous basis a compare to the time last year when we have to announce programme for transformation without detailed preparation of implementable and affordable plan we be now in the fortunate situation that we be well on the way to finalise detailed plan to meet our firm commitment to build a well life for all south african once they be ready and after the necessary consultation with the elect representative at both national and provincial level the local community structure and the public at large we be determine this year to move speedily to expedite the process of social transformation and the improvement of the quality of life of our people which be require of u in the context of our programme for reconstruction and development this will be one of the high point in our national life this year when we announce realistic target with regard to such need a house clean water primary health care and job i must repeat that it be our firm intention that we set these target within the parameter of what the budget can carry consistent with our objective of ensure fiscal discipline we will be able to achieve this degree of precision because of the significant progress that have be make in the various ministry at both national and provincial level with regard both to the reorganisation and strengthen these structure and the elaboration of policy aim at the fundamental transformation of our country for this we should salute the minister the premier the director general and other member of the public service for the work they have do to increase the capacity of government to engage in the process of transformation with regard to this critical matter of socioeconomic transformation i would once again like to draw attention to the important role that nedlac will have to play to ensure effective coordination and partnership between government labour business and communitybased organisation this body will play a critical role in help to develop the consensus we need with regard to the critical challenge of reconstruction and development include economic growth socioeconomic improvement and the involvement of all stakeholder in all decisionmaking process in a sense nedlac and other forum where consensus be be achieve across the social spectrum be crucial power house of our nationbuilding and reconstruction effort they be the engine which can not be derail by the whim of individual or political party a the year begin there be sign that our economy be begin to pick up the government sondiers it a matter of critical importance that everything should be do to encourage a climate conducive to sustain and high level of economic growth we be therefore ready to deal and have be deal with all matter that be relevant to this goal in particular to ensure the creation of an investorfriendly climate everything must be do to encourage a significant upward movement in the rate of investment to increase the productive capacity of the economy to modernise and restructure the economy to create job and to increase our international competitiveness with regard to these economic issue i would also like to emphasise our continue commitment to fiscal discipline include the reduction of the budget deficit the reduction of the share of the national income that accrues to government and the reorientation of government expenditure away from recurrent disbursement towards investment the relevant authority include the reserve bank remain seize of the issue of the twotier exchange rate and the general question of foreign exchange control these matter will be address with the necessary speed and the equally necessary sense of responsibility towards the economy a a whole at the same time the government be work a expeditiously a possible to address the question of the reorganisation of state asset with regard to these asset our objective be to ensure that they be use in a conscious and consistent manner to address the objective of the rdp one of these must surely be to reduce the public debt and therefore the burden of service this debt so that more public fund can be release to address the need of the people this year parliament will be face with a heavy load of extremely important legislation that it will have to deal with the importance of this legislation derives from the fact that it will be transformative in character aim at the creation of the social order which for which many struggle and sacrifice one of these piece of legislation be the labour relation bill which represent not only a decisive shift from our adversarial past in labour relation but also our commitment to a more democratic style of governance while correctly entrench the right of worker to resort to strike action the bill place emphasis on conciliation and negotiation of dispute and should contribute significantly to reduce the level of unnecessary industrial action and create great possibility for joint action between government labour and business to build a prosperous and just society similarly white paper and legislation will be introduce cover such area a education health housing water affair safety and security defence truth and reconciliation freedom of information land affair the public service welfare and so on to say nothing of the 199596 budget this will undoubtedly tax the energy of the member and resource of parliament however we will have to ensure that we deal with all this legislation a expeditiously a possible while consult the people also a extensively a possible we should therefore have an excite session which should inspire all or people a they see their elect representative create the legislative framework which will mark our continued movement away from the past towards the peoplecentred society we seek to construct we will also have to ensure that the constitutional assembly make progress towards the draft to the new constitution it be important that this should be do so that we can have certainty a soon a possible about the constitutional framework within which the country should be govern it may be worth repeat that we seek a constitution that be acceptable to the people a a whole it be for this reason that all of those who participate in the draft of the present constitution agree to the concept of special majority and an entrenchment set of principle a we negotiate the new constitution it be necessary to bear these observation in mind and conduct ourselves in a manner that ensures that we have a inclusive a process a possible it seem necessary that there should be close cooperation and coordination between the legislature and the constitutional assembly with regard to the issue of consultation with the public a both these body will be seek to reach a many people a possible during this year we will have to conduct the process of public consultation in a manner that be both cost effective and enables the people genuinely to contribute both to the legislative and the constitutional debate this year the nation will be observe the related 50th anniversary of the end of the second world war and the establishment of the united nation organisation come a we do from our own specific past it will be important that we join in the observance of these historic event thus should we affirm our own commitment to the vision contain in the universal declaration on human right the un charter and other important legal instrument and convention that the un have evolve to deal with the issue of racism war and peace human right and development among these convention which will be ratify during the course of this parliamentary session be the very important international convention on the right of the child we might also want to use this occasion to make our contribution to the international debate about the new world order focus in particular on such matter a a democratic international political order universal prosperity peace and stability all of which be question of great relevance to our own continent of africa in this regard the un social summit next month and the international woman conference in beijing later in the year will be crucial forum in which we should make our own humble contribution to the effort to create a well world in this context during this year we will pay particular attention to the allround development and strengthen of our relation with our neighbour in southern africa especially within the context of the sadc we be all inspire by the reality of progressive development in our region during the recent period these include the successful democratic election in malawi mozambique namibia botswana and our own country the restoration of democracy in lesotho and the signing of the angola peace agreement all this augur well for the future of all our people at the same time we be all aware of the tension that be building up with regard to population movement within our region we must treat this matter with all due sensitivity conscious of the history of our region include the destruction cause by the policy of aggression and destabilisation carry out by the previous regime in all our action we must move from the position that the fundamental objective we must pursue be friendship cooperation and solidarity among the people of our region we rake this opportunity to wish the people of angola well and once more to convey to them and all their leader our willingness to contribute whatever we can to assist in the establishment of a permanent peace and the strengthen of the democratic order we will continue to make our contribution to the strengthen of the oau which remains an important instrument that we all

1994_pre_elections_deKlerk.txt,mr speakerthis parliament have convene to adopt important amendment to the constitution of the republic of south africa act 1993 the fact that we have do so in the midst of the most crucial election campaign of our national history speaks for itself it be an indication of the importance which we attach to ensure that the come election be a inclusive a possible if we wish to have a peaceful and stable future it be of the great importance that a many of our people and party a possible should participate in this historical process it be essential that noone and no party should be able to claim that they be exclude or that their reasonable concern have not be accommodate in the transitional constitution it be to this end that the government the national party and other participate party have go out of their way particularly during the past week to accommodate the concern raise by the party of the freedom alliance the concern of the freedom alliance a distil from week of hard negotiation include the followingthe freedom alliance say they want strong assurance relate to the autonomy of province with regard to their power function and boundary the amendment of section 126 of the constitution deletes the reference to concurrency thus it be make absolutely clear that law pass by the provincial legislature will in general prevail over law pass by the national parliament on matter reserve for the province only in exceptional circumstance specifically provide for will the position be different the freedom alliance be particularly concerned that a future government might try to diminish the power of the province in the final constitution the amendment of constitutional principle xviii provide that the power and function of province will not be substantially diminish in the final constitution there be those who read something sinister in the word substantially however i be assure that it be a technical provision which can not be misuse to undermine the scope of provincial power or autonomy in any meaningful way it be there merely to provide for some minor change which might to agree upon the provincial provision accord to the freedom alliance it must also be recall that no constitutional principle can be change after the election even by a 100 majority in parliament the freedom alliance want the provision to have great fiscal and financial autonomy the amendment of section 155159 of the constitution will strengthen the tax competence of the province and go a long way in meeting the requirement of the freedom alliance the freedom alliance ask for great power for the province in draw up their own constitution the amendment of section 160 of the constitution will enable provincial legislature to include specific provision in their own constitution regard their own legislative and executive structure this will allow province to legislate for their unique requirement it will for example enable the province of kwazulunatal to make special provision for the zulu monarchy simultaneously it creates room for asymmetry between province the freedom alliance want the name of natal to be change to kwazulunatal the propose amendment to the transitional constitution will make this possible another major concern of the freedom alliance be that there should be two separate ballot in the election one for the national parliament and one for the provincial legislature this will be achieve by amendment to the electoral act which will be amend to extend the deadline for party to register for the election until 4 march 1994 another principal concern of the freedom alliance and particularly of the afrikaner volksfront be it demand for selfdetermination within a volkstaat even this concern will be address in t he propose constitutional amendment a new constitutional principle will be add on the subject of selfdetermination include the possibility that it might be exercise in a territorial entity if constitutionally agree provision be also make by amend chapter 11 to create a mechanism for conduct far negotiation of the subject of a volkstaat for those who really want it the government believe that it and the other negotiate party have now do everything within reason to address the main concern of the freedom alliance the fact be that the transitional constitution will bring into be province with genuine autonomous power base on federal principle those power be strongly entrench and can not be arbitrarily diminish by the central government in term of either the transitional constitution or the final constitution voter will have a double ballot a request by the freedom alliance party province will have extend and independent taxation power their power have be far extend and clarify and they will be able to adopt their own constitution the province of natal will be know a kwazulunatal a request the door have be open to continued negotiation around the concept of a volkstaat there can now no longer be any reasonable excuse for nonparticipation in the election and in the continue national constitutional process we will achieve these improvement to the transitional constitution by adopt amendment in this parliament however i have for some time have a suspicion that the freedom alliance main difficulty have not be so much with the text of the constitution but with the broader reality of our time this parliament can amend the transitional constitution but it can not amend reality it can not amend the reality that the afrikaner be in a minority in all the recognise and historical region of south africa it can not amend the reality that all south african be inextricably interdependent economically socially and constitutionally it can not and should not amend the reality that all south african have a right to participate in the process of government without be subject to any form of discrimination party may continue to boycott the constitutional process but ultimately they will not be able to avoid these reality by boycotting the election they will wastefully exclude themselves and their follower from make their full contribution tot he constitutional future of south africa and to the peaceful promotion of their own value and ideal however nonparticipation though regrettable and wasteful be a legitimate option if party choose this route it be their right to do so i must however stress that whether they decide to participate in the process or not we be determine to proceed with the election on 2628 april and with the implementation of the transitional constitution we dare not allow any minority to deprive the great majority south african of their longawaited desire to elect national and provincial government which will for the first time in our history be truly representative of all south african we dare not allow anyone to stand in the way of the rapid economic growth and development which can come about only through a constitutional settlement which enjoys internal and external legitimacy we will not allow anyone to deprive south african of the hardwon and painstakingly negotiate right which be now entrench in the our constitutional system a i have say it be the right of any party to boycott the election it be also the right of any party to continue to pursue it objective by peaceful and constitutional mean however i will strenuously oppose any attempt by any party to prevent any south african citizen from exercise his or her right to participate in the election the government will not tolerate any attempt by any party to disrupt the election the government will use all the mean at it disposal include the security force to deal with any party which might seek to achieve it objective through violence or through unconstitutional illegal or undemocratic mean party which contemplate secession or the illegal seizure of state or municipal power should have no illusion concern their position or the consequence of their action they should have no illusion concern their support they constitute a minority of the total south african population and within each province if they disagree with this contention participation in the election would be the best way of prove their real support the afrikaner volksfront have no right to claim to speak on behalf of the afrikaans people the represent only a faction and a it be a divide faction the vast majority of afrikaner be decent peaceloving and sensible people who dearly with to find a peaceful and workable modus vivendi with the other people of south africa they have no wish to become involve in a futile and meaningless war against their brother afrikaner they have no interest in lose their job their home and everything they own in pursuit of a hopeless illusion they should have no illusion that they will receive any international support there be no way that the international community ever would or ever could accept a state base once again on minority racial domination and racial discrimination there can be no return to apartheid and any effort in that direction will end in conflict total isolation and utter and complete economic ruin neither should he party involve have any illusion with regard to the role of the security force the south african defence force and the south african police be highly professional and dedicate force they have a long and proud tradition of loyal service to the government of the day they have a key role to play in uphold the integrity of the new state and of our constitution and they will play that role there be simply no future on the road of unconstitutional and violent activity i appeal to any of those who might be consider this road to turn back before it be too late i have a deep understand for the concern of the zulu king and his people in respect of the future of the zulu monarchy we have be involve in serious and indepth discussion about he issue unfortunately we have not be ableas yet to each specific agreement on how to address these concern a far a i be concerned negotiation must continue until agreement be achieve there should however be no doubt a to where i the government and the party which i lead stand in this regard the zulu kingdom be recognise by u a a unique reality it have a proud history and it play an important role in the life of the zulu nation we support the principle that the zulu kingdom must receive constitutional recognition also through effective constitutional safeguard your voice heard the best defence against the abuse of your right will be ensure that the new parliament a be balance a possible that no party emerges with too much power if you wish to oppose those with whom you strongly disagree do so within the framework provide by the transitional constitution and not through selfdestructive involvement in violent and unconstitutional action if you have concern or if you feel threaten seek protection from the institution which the new constitution creates remember that the process of constitutional development will not end with the election of the new parliament one of it most important task will be to draw up a final constitution constitutional negotiation will accordingly continue within the new parliament and all party in the national assembly will be able to promote their interest and objective in the ongoing constitutional debate it be critically important that all significant south african political party should be part of this process during the past four year we have succeed in bring south africa from the brink of catastropheour society be deeply dividedwe be on the brink of conflictour country be ostracise and isolatedour economy be in a hopeless downward spiral during the past four year we have succeed in break out of this hopeless situation we have succeed in negotiate a transitional constitution which can provide the basis for a prosperous and peaceful society which guarantee great right and freedom not only for those who previously do not have the vote but for all south african when we awake on 29 april we will be freer than we have ever be before let u therefore now move forward,28 February 1994,1994,deKlerk

place of war and conflict reverse for good the false dawn of a hundred year ago that be the conclusion in 1909 of the national convention which presage the formation of the union of south africa while that convention define the territorial integrity of south africa a we know it today it be base on racial oppression and exclusion and so 15 year into our democracy we can assert that the fear the

steadily improve the structure of governance we have built a system of healthy intergovernmental relation across the sphere and improve integration within and among them indeed government can be proud that we have change the demographic composition of the public service which in virtually all respect approximates the character of our society however while woman constitute about 34 of all senior position in the public service this fall short of the target of parity that we have set ourselves at the level of the national and provincial legislature indication be that the nation will this year surpass the 32 woman representation level achieve in 2004 and hopefully even the 40 achieve in the 2006 local government election we hope that all political party will a they finalise their electoral list make their contribution to this noble endeavourthough some progress have be make at 02 the situation be less impressive with regard to people with disability employ in government measure against the 2 target we set ourselves on both count the private sector be lag far behind various measure have be put in place to improve the efficiency of the public service include financial management thusong service centre and other service delivery innovation izimbizo and a currently in the department of home affair firm leadership however much more need to be do to improve the service culture and orientation of some public servant especially those at the coalface of direct interaction with the public a honourable member will be aware our government have make the fight against corruption one of the core area of focus this be reflect among others in legislation rule and regulation govern public servant and political officebearers alike partnership with civil society and the business community a well a anticorruption hotlines it may a well be that the system of prevent and punish corruption be still inadequate but from the point of view of government system we can draw solace from the fact that over 70 of case of corruption report in the medium become public because government have detect the wrongdoing and be in fact act against it the same challenge confront the private sector in the end the challenge be a much about regulation a it be about consistent enforcement honourable membersi be certain that we be all agree that the wellbeing of our society depends critically on the progress we make in expand the nation wealth and ensure that the benefit of economic growth be share by the people a a whole it be common cause that after the economic stagnation of the late 1980s and early 1990s south africa have experienced the long period of sustain economic growth since the record of such statistic start in 1940 in the first decade of freedom economic growth average 3 per year and this improve to 5 per year on average from 2004 to 2007 while the consumer boom impel by rise employment and income and low inflation and interest rate played it part in this regard we be encourage by the broad canvas of opportunity for far expansion go forward these include in the first instance high rate of investment by both the public and private sector in this regard some five year ago we be hover around 16 of gross fix capital formation a a percentage of gross domestic product gdp such have be the acceleration in investment that today this figure stand at 22 closer to the 25 that we project to attain only in 2014 this be in part a consequence of deliberate programme by government to expand public infrastructure it be also a result of policy to improve the climate for private sector investment and to conduct fiscal and monetary policy in a manner that expands access to service and reduces the inflationary burden while at the same time ensure macroeconomic stability and sustainability the focus on microeconomic reform in the past decade and the effort especially since 2004 more systematically to remove the variety of obstacle to growth have have a positive impact it be in this context that the accelerate and share growth initiative asgisa be be implement ensure that all the critical blockage such a infrastructure bottleneck integrate industrial policy and programme the skill challenge regulatory gridlock and efficiency of government service be address in a focus and systematic manner our economy have become more open and since 1994 it have steadily become integrate into the global system our financial institution be a force of good example which have somewhat shelter u from the global economic storm yet the extent of their reach within our society remains far below expectation our economy remains largely reliant on mining and agriculture for export except for the service sector we have not see a large enough expansion in critical sector especially manufacturing a such the rate of growth in export have not be a high a in comparable country it be precisely this weakness which account for the large current account deficit particularly when we enter high range of growth and because we have a low saving rate we have have to rely on shortterm capital flow to finance the deficit a well a our investment programme these be challenge that our country will certainly have to address go forward of critical importance be the question what in fact should economic growth be about wealth be create in order to improve people quality of life thus the question whether growth be equitably share should form a central pillar of all our economic consideration importantly share the benefit of growth should entail labourabsorption ensure that there be decent work indeed it be a matter of proud record that between 1995 and 2003 the economy create about oneandhalf million net new job and even more remarkable about 500 000 job a year between 2004 and 2007 in this latter period for the first time since the attainment of democracy more job be be create than the number of new entrant into the labour market thus reduce the unemployment rate from 31 in 2003 to 23 in 2007 of course this should not detract from our obligation to continue interrogate the issue of the quality of these job include the right and benefit that worker enjoy share the benefit of growth should also include accelerate implementation of affirmative action include broadbased black economic empowerment this be not in pursuit of a socalled racial agenda in reality a country that do not ensure the involvement of all of it population at all level of economic activity be certainly go to perform well below it actual potential the fact that the private sector lag behind in change the demographic of management and skilled occupation in enterprise development and so on in part make our country a laggard in the high growth stake share the benefit of growth also mean an efficient and equitable role for the state in use the fiscus a an instrument of redistribution and share the burden of provide public good honourable member will be familiar with most of the data on matter relate to the social wage i will however cite a few instance again to sketch out the nature of the progress we have make and the challenge that we face government be painfully aware that abject poverty be still too widespread in our society and the level of inequality be too high we have in the past 15 year do our best to attack this scourge through the social wage to quote work conduct by a team of academic at the university of stellenbosch lead by professor servaas van der bergfirstly moneymetric poverty decline substantially since the turn of the century the reduction be to a large extent due to a dramatic expansion in social grant expenditure from 2002 onwards this improvement be mirror in access to basic service a rapid decline in asset poverty even precede the decline in moneymetric poverty secondly although the reduction in poverty have be substantial aggregate inequality increase during the 1990s thirdly the dynamic underlie the poverty and inequality trend determine the broad policy outlookppoverty have decrease since the transition but inequality have not improve poverty since the transition what we know p8 van der berg et al august 2007on a critical matter of detail the researcher far observeamong household that include child define a those age 17 and young the number of household reporting that a child go hungry decline dramatically from just over 31 per cent to 16 per cent between 2002 and 2006 this suggests that the poverty situation have improve remarkably particularly among people experience the great degree of welfare deprivation the prevalence of hunger among child have virtually halve over four year poverty since the transition what we know p25 van der berg et al august 2007indeed these observation be confirm by our own research which show that income poverty especially among african and colour community have decline partly a a result of high rate of employment and access to social grant while the number of grant beneficiary be 25million in 1999 by 2008 this have increase to 124million this be largely a result of massive expansion in access to the child support grant which increase from 34thousand beneficiary in 1999 to 81million in 2008 a part of the contribution to the income of the poor the target for 1million work opportunity through the expand public work programme be attain in 2008 a year earlier than envisage in the 2004 electoral mandate this have create the possibility massively to expand this programme and improve it quality with regard to household access to basic service the figure speak for themselves for instance access to potable water have improve from 62 in 1996 to 88 in 2008 electricity 58 to 72 and sanitation 52 to 73 evidence of the social wage be also see in massive improvement in access to primary health facility 95 of south african now live within 5 kilometre of a health facility and we be inform that all clinic now have access to potable water child immunisation coverage have steadily increase to about 85 and malaria case have massively decline we be also hearten that research into hiv prevalence demonstrates stabilisation and a slight reduction in rate of infection far our antiretroviral treatment programme be not only the large in the world but it be expand all the time with over 690 000 patient have be initiate on antiretroviral treatment since the commencement of the programme yet many health facility do not always have the require medicine appropriate staff level and constant supply of basic service such a clean run water and electricity in some of these facility management be poor and staff attitude need improvement in education we have see a drop in the educator learner ratio almost universal access in term of enrolment at primary school level and an improvement in the number of pupil passing mathematics to quote a few example at the same time much effort have be put into improve infrastructure in poor area of course we do know that the dropout rate particularly at secondary and tertiary level be unacceptably high and the educational system have yet to produce the requisite kind of skill need by society in addition trend in performance both in term of teach and learn show a worry persistence of the social division of the past ironically precisely where education be most need to help break the cycle of poverty be where infrastructure administrative and teacher capacity be least impressive government social programme have also improve the asset base of the poor in the form of housing with 26million subsidise house provide we should of course acknowledge that the land redistribution programme a well a postsettlement support could have be handle faster and well overall we be proud of the advance in our social programme but we can not satisfy ourselves merely with quantitative change be it in education health housing water or sanitation the central question that confronts u every day be how to improve the quality of these service on this we still have some way to go honourable membersthe scourge of crime remains a major source of insecurity for south african daily experience in poor and affluent neighbourhood alike be one of apprehension at the possibility of violent attack within public and private institution the possibility of nefarious scheme siphon off resource through corruption be always a source of great concernof course the overall crime rate have peaked in 2002 have consistently decline all kind of statistic can be cite to attest to this but we do know that the reduction have not be fast enough not even at the 710 rate that we set ourselves for various category of contact crime the fact that incident of violent robbery in household and business have be on the increase and crime against woman and child have not abate in any significant measure be a matter of great concern this point to weakness in our neighbourhood especially in building the bond of community solidarity that would assist u in prevent and combat crime it point to systemic weakness in the criminal justice system from investigation of crime to rehabilitation of offender it point to weakness in the efficiency of the court system both in term of technical and other infrastructure and management these be the issue that the comprehensive revamp of the criminal justice system have start to address yet in be brutally selfcritical we should not lose sight of the fact that what we be assess be a system that enjoys by far well legitimacy than ever experienced in our country this be because of the transformation these institution have undergone in term of their doctrine base on a human right culture their demographic composition and their system of accountability but let u not delude ourselves a with the rest of our social life such transformation be still at it nascent stage we still have a long way to go i be certain that honourable member will agree that the humanity of our democratic dispensation should find expression in the extent to which we pay attention to the most vulnerable in society in this regard we have through legislation international convention regulation and campaign ensure that concrete effort be make to improve the condition of child woman people with disability and the elderly through advocacy campaign and indeed a a result of the partnership we have built with organisation represent these vulnerable group we have improve awareness around issue that affect them and progressively encourage the mainstreaming of these concern it be a matter of proud record that for instance femaleheaded household have receive a biggerthanaverage share of the social wage include housing and health care and that among the most successful programme have be campaign on child immunisation and nutrition yet access to employment weighs heavily on rural woman youth and people with disability hiv impact most severely on young woman violence against woman and child be much too high all these be assignment for the come period madame speaker and honourable chairpersonthese then be some of the advance that democracy have brought and the progress that government have make in fulfil the mandate of the electorate there be no gainsay that by any measure the progress make since 1994 have be impressive but neither can there be doubt that the challenge remain immense it be apt therefore to remind ourselves of that instructive observation of hope and resilience continuity and change by former president nelson mandela in his biography long walk to freedomi have walk that long road to freedom i have try not to falter i have make misstep along the way but i have discover the secret that after climb a great hill one only find that there be many more hill to climb i have take a moment here to rest to steal a view of the glorious vista that surround me to look back on the distance i have come but i can rest only for a moment for with freedom come responsibility and i dare not linger for my long walk be not yet end in a few month from now the people of our country will pronounce on the leadership they prefer to carry forward the noble work of this great freedom fighter and other founder of our democracy while our approach may differ the objective that we need to aim for be clearly and unambiguously set out in our constitution to create a united nonracial nonsexist democratic and prosperous society that play a positive role in building a well world six year ago leader of our people come together in a growth and development summit and reach agreement on the task all of u should undertake to improve the quality of life of south african particularly to halve unemployment and poverty by 2014 these includecreating more job well job and decent work for all through high rate of investment public work programme sector partnership and strategy local procurement small enterprise promotion and support for cooperativesaddressing the investment challenge by improve saving appropriately deploy resource from pension and provident fund housing financial sector contribution and black economic empowermentadvancing equity develop skill create economic opportunity and extend service andlocal action and implementation for development include provision of infrastructure and access to basic service i be certain that a part of and in addition to these objective south african would hardly differ regard the need to improve our education system to provide efficient decent and equitable health care to develop our rural area and ensure food security and to intensify the fight against crime and corruption i cite these issue not because they be allencompassing nor that by identify them we would cure all the ill of our society rather i have chosen to do so to emphasise the point that south africa do not suffer the poverty of vision our challenge be to translate these vision into programme and project for effective implementation these ideal be share by virtually all of humanity a reflect in the united nation millennium development goal and yet humanity today face the danger that the attainment of these objective could be postpone by many year if not decade a a consequence of the economic crisis that have engulfed the global village what on the surface start off a a financial crisis among a few lending institution have explode into a global credit crunch with severe consequence for actual production and trade we can decry the greed the shorttermism and the carelessness of manager of big corporation which precipitate the crisis we can condemn the policy of government which take their eye off the ball and allow the rapacious licence of unregulated market to wreak havoc on financial system we can do all this and we will be perfectly justified yet our central and immediate task be fully to appreciate the consequence of these development on our own economy and our region and devise response that will minimise their impact especially on the most vulnerable sector of our society what we do know be that the regulatory environment in our country and the countercyclical budget policy we adopt have help u avoid the bad impact of the crisis but we be all too aware that because we be strongly integrate into the world economy demand for our export have decline access to finance and inflow of capital have turn for the bad low demand have precipitate a scale down of production the creation of job be negatively affected and in some sector retrenchment have become a reality these difficulty have coincide with a period in which inflation and interest rate be still too high our thanks to the governor of the reserve bank who yesterday announce a 1 reduction in the rate of interest combine these development bode ill for the revenue we need to expand the provision of service and to implement our infrastructure project a such we have be force to tone down our forecast in term of growth and jobcreation we know too that south africa be less severely affected than many other country indeed in a period in which others be experience or project recession south africa and the rest of the continent be still poise for growth even if at a slow rate in this regard honourable member i be happy to report that in the interaction between the presidency and leader of various social partner we agree jointly to devise intervention that would minimise the impact of this crisis on our society the task team deal with these matter be still hard at work and the follow broad category of response be under discussionfirstly government will continue with it public investment project the value of which have increase to r690billion for the next three year in this regard where necessary we will find creative way to raise fund this will include support by our development finance institution and loan finance from international agency a well a partnership with the private sector and utilisation of resource control by worker such a pension fund secondly we will intensify public sector employment programme on the one hand plan to expand employment in sector such a health social work education and lawenforcement agency will continue on the other we will speed up the introduction of the next phase of the expand public work programme thirdly mitigate action can be undertaken within the private sector to counteract an excessive investment slowdown and unnecessary closure of production line or plant on it part government will adapt industrial financing and incentive instrument to help deal with challenge in various sector and also encourage development finance institution to assist firm in distress because of the crisis alternative to layoff will be explore include longer holiday extend training short time and jobsharing this will be combine with promotion of the proudly south africa campaign and strong action on illegal import fourthly government will sustain and expand social expenditure include progressively extend access to the child support grant to child of 18 year of age and reduce the age of eligibility for old age pension to 60 year for men in addition we will more widely utilise the social distress relief grant and food security measure specifically also to target those either unprotected by the unemployment insurance fund or who have exhaust their benefit we shall also continue to pay special attention to the challenge of anticompetitive behaviour on the part of some of our corporation in this regard we wish to commend the competition commission for the firm hand that they be show to ensure that culprit be brought to book we do hope though that civil society will enhance it own level of activism to ensure among other thing that a input price decline the benefit be felt by the population these immediate measure will be inform by the principle of a countercyclical fiscal policy however we will ensure that the level of borrowing by government be prudent and sustainable this also implies a rapid reduction in government debt level whenever condition turn for the well our effort will also be inform by the appreciation that measure to protect the environment and mitigate the impact of climate change can also contribute to jobcreation both in the g20 meeting and other interaction in multilateral institution our government have argue for appropriate and urgent intervention particularly in the developed country whence the crisis originate and where it be most severe we believe that the time have come to strengthen domestic regulation and supervision of the financial system but beyond this that strong surveillance and action on a global scale have become unavoidable and necessary critically we should also safeguard the integrity of the world trade system complete the current negotiation on the doha round of world trade negotiation and ensure that development aid be not scale down the abide lesson from this experience be that we need strong partnership among economic role player on a domestic and global scale not only to stem the impact of the crisis but also to put in place measure that would obviate a recurrence in our own country we will embark on these undertaking a part of the process of set our society on a high growth and development path the length of time towards attain a high trajectory may have be stretch somewhat but we be not in doubt that that moment will yet come sooner rather than later in this regard how we position our country to take advantage of unique opportunity that have come our way will be of paramount importance i refer here in particular to the fifa world cup in 2010 a well a the confederation cup a few month from now virtually all the project and plan be complete or near completion from stadium transport infrastructure security measure issue of accommodation to health and immigration plan confirm the confidence of the global soccer fraternity that ours will be a truly successful tournament and we believe that after five consecutive win the national soccer team be now more confidently gear itself to perform above expectationsbut beyond this the true legacy of this spectacle will be in our ability to showcase south african and african hospitality and humanity to change once and for all perception of our country and our continent among people of the world that depends on all of u and to that we can attach no pricewe also wish in this regard to congratulate all our sport team which have assert south africa pursuit of excellence over the past year special accolade be due to our cricket team which have climbed to the apex of global ranking we be of course

1999_pre_elections_Mandela.txt,madame speaker and deputy speaker of the national assembly honourable chairperson and deputy chairperson of the national council of province honourable member of parliament distinguish guest lady and gentlementoday we start the ultimate session of our first democratic parliament the profound change of the past fourandhalf year make the distance traverse seem so short the end so sudden yet with the epochmaking progress that have be make this period could have be decade south africa be in a momentous process of change blazing a trail towards a secure future the time be yet to come for farewell a many of u by choice or circumstance will not return however there be no time to pause the long walk be not yet over the prize of a well life have yet to be wonallow me madame speaker to cast my eye far back than the period under review ten year ago in a letter to the head of the apartheid state in an attempt to launch negotiation one humble prisoner say that at a first meeting between government and the anc two central issue need to be address firstly the demand for majority rule in a unitary state secondly the concern of white south african over this demand a well a the insistence of white on structural guarantee that majority rule will not mean domination of the white minority by blacksin yet another letter it be emphasisedthe very first step on the way to reconciliation be obviously the dismantle of apartheid and all measure use to reinforce it to talk of reconciliation before this major step be take be totally unrealisticthese be some of the matter that i will address today our transition have be manage with such success that some generously invoke the imagery of miracle thing such a equality the right to vote in free and fair election and freedom of speech many of u now take for grant many past difficulty be now mere footnote of history there can be no equivocation that the majority of south african coalesce around our found pact be outgrow the apprehension which require the convolute structural guarantee of the first few year though we might differ on method it have become a national passion to pronounce commitment to a well life for all what then be the nation scorecard on the fundamental question of socioeconomic changecensus 96 whose result be make public last year have for the first time give south africa a detailed and comprehensive portrait of itself and it be against it dimension that we must measure our progress in 1994 some 30 of south african lack access to a safe supply of water near their home today after three million people have benefit from the government water supply programme that have be reduce to 20 in 1994 less than 40 of south african household have electricity today after more than 2 million connection 63 of household be connect to the electricity grid in 1ds4 about a quarter of home have telephone today after 1 3million have be connect 35 be link to the telephone system this mean that every day on average since our democratic election have meant another 1300 home electrify another 750 telephone instal and another 1700 people gain access to clean water every daywith the primary school nutrition programme reach over 5million child and the benefit of free health care million of child be grow healthy and unstunted within the framework of our integrate national disability strategy today we have a government whose concern for the need of the disabled be unprecedented in the history of south africa this mean more than the dry rhyme of statistic the word of m gladys nzilane of evaton who receive key to her new house last year ring true from the hearti hear people on radio and television say the government have fail but i do not believe that this government have give u life in this she be echo the feeling of million include mama lenah ntsweni of mpumalanga who be the 3rnillionth person to receive safe and accessible water a few week ago before we lose ourselves in detail important though it may be let u come back to the trend the critical question be about a machinery which be improve it capacity to meet the need of south african even where we might not have met our target this be the question that we need to probe such be the experience in the provision of subsidise housing with 700thousand house either built or under construction we do acknowledge that we shall not reach the target of one million that we set ourselves but after the initial hiccup of the first two year we have now developed the capacity to build 15000 house every month from the job summit new initiative have emerge in a splendid partnership between business and government to start major project that will put more roof over the head of those in want a this project start unlock the problem of limited public resource so will it beneficiary multiply from the supplier of building material to the small building contractor from the new employee to those who will occupy these dwelling the construction of sport facility reach new level in 1998 and the establishment of community art centre exceed the target new way of facilitate land restitution and redistribution be be implement the adult basic education and training programme have reach more people than be originally plan in the area of welfare after the pain of restructuring the reach and the efficiency of delivery have improve and r350million be be save a year by well management and eliminate corruption the example be many but let u focus for a brief moment on two of the issue namely welfare and education the saving that have be effect through tackle fraud should rightly contribute to an expansion of assistance to those in need during this year of old person all of u and i do include myself be especially aware of the need of senior citizen we be therefore pleased to announce that we be able once again to increase old age pension this year by 4 that be r20 and the disability grant by the same percentage regard education why be it that the majority of south african feel that thing have improve in this areathis be because many of those who be study under tree or in dilapidate building have benefit from the r1billion spent on the construction or renovation of 10000 classroom it be because the door of all public school be open it be because the high education assistance scheme be reach more student it be because despite the setback of one or another year the matric result be improve and even if this majority do not read or hear or see in the medium the praise that be due when the matric examination be conduct without a major incident they do not need to be told for they live these experience last year we make the observation that it be inexcusable that textbook be not supply within seven day of the begin of the schoolterm many area do meet this target however many do not we hope that this year the planning and funding will be settle earlier in the year for if this do not happen after the pressure experience of last year if our administration be unable to carry out such a straightforward project then in the come year ordinary citizen like myself will feel justified in call so to speak for head to rollhonourable member and delegateswhat this experience with textbook say to u be that capacity can not be built through ordinary motion of government a we know it i know deputy president thabo mbeki have take this issue to heart that be how to restructure government with the prime objective of fulfil peoplecentred function rather than merely observe selfserving and archaic rule such be the challenge in deal with the difficult area of crime and jobcreation on both these issue there be naturally public impatience so the question we need to ask be whether there be a possibility of a strategic and visible break with the perception of stagnationit be not my task at this last sit of parliament to set out medium and longterm programme but i feel more than confident to say that on both count with regard to crime and jobcreation there be hope what be the trend and concrete measure on crimethe statistic show that there have be a reduction or stabilisation in most serious crime murder for instance have decline by 10 since 1994 but the response be make that figure be meaningless in the context of people concrete experience a myriad of law have be pass to narrow the space for criminal the late among these be legislation on crime syndicate a well a minimum sentence and condition on the grant of bail but the response be that not enough criminal be be arrest and the quality of investigation be poor a detective academy have be set up and the skill gather here be start to be felt in deal with crime syndicate and major step have be take to deploy police where they be need most but the response be where be the resultsall these response arise from a failure to appreciate the fact that turn the tide against crime can not be achieve overnight there be also deliberate effort to sensationalise and politicise this issue but we be the first to acknowledge that the impatience and dissatisfaction among ordinary people be justified we can and shall break out of this bog there be hope examine the experience of the johannesburg central precinct and the durban beachfront where community and businesspeople have join with police and cut the crime rate and you will know there be hope ask the kingpin of cashintransit heist who be in cmax and you will know there be hope ask the corrupt police who be face various charge and you will know there be hope even though the level of attack be rather too high ass the trend in farm community after the summit on this issue and you will know there be hope for this we salute the men and woman in blue the overwhelm majority of them citizen of outstanding bravery and integrity men and woman who daily put their life on the line so that the nation can enjoy security above all the establishment of the office of the national director of public prosecution and along with it the special investigation unit have already show that a systematic approach to major crime combine intelligence professional investigation and prosecution be bound to bear fruit and in express our appreciation to the intelligence service for their contribution in this and other area to guarantee our people security i wish to join the public in say more can be do and more must be do question have be ask whether we have get the balance right between the right of criminal and those of ordinary citizen this government be not about to join the chorus baying for the death sentence or to reverse our human right gain yet in addition to the measure we introduce regard bail and mandatory sentence we need to examine space that need tighten for instance should interference with witness and murder of policeman and woman not attract very harsh mandatory sentence what about the form and content of evidence that should be give to defence attorney in bail application for it do not help for the police to do their work and for the justice system to be efficient if criminal will subvert investigation and prosecution by violent and foul mean these be just some of the issue that need to be address along with and i should underline along with the plod industry on all front which will take many year to bring crime down to acceptable level let me also briefly reflect on recent development in cape town without presume any organisation or individual guilty there be some obvious thing that can not be conceal firstly what start off expressly a a campaign against gangsterism have now become a violent and murderous offensive against ordinary citizen and lawenforcement agency secondly what be portrayed a moral and godinspired against oppression exploitation and imperialism have assume the form of terrorism to undercut cape town lifeline and destabilise a democratic government thirdly what be undertaken a an expression of militancy could now very easily provide cover for rightwing counterrevolution against the new south africa this campaign be rotten to the core it be misguide and it attempt to invoke religion be blasphemous what south african indeed who owes loyalty to this country and this continent would engage in such callous deed what fighter against crime would engage in a campaign that diverts resource of the police from deal with criminalsi want to assure the people of cape town that we know who these people be we know who train and back them and steadily we be building watertight case against them that will ensure that they stay in jail for a long long time let me reiterate the battle against crime have be join and we have no doubt at all about who the victor will be madame speakerthere be hope too in the area of jobcreation for a start if economic growth last year and this year be less encourage we be confident that this be an exception that confirms an otherwise upward trend indeed in this era of volatility what we need to ask ourselves be why south africa do not experience the kind of paralyse turbulence that be the lot of most country at our level of development the answer be that our fundamental be robust local and foreign fix investment be on the rise though not at the pace we would prefer export be increase and in some area of agriculture for instance the increase have be by a much a 1000 steadily our economy be become more competitive telecommunication and tourism be grow at an impressive rate road construction and spatial development initiative be expand the economic base of region that be ignore in the past public work programme have create hundred of thousand of job though some of them be temporary we have also take impressive stride in the restructuring of state asset and let u remind ourselves that some of the success in the provision of service derive directly from this we be determine to continue with this programme but to do it in a way that be systematic and professional and benefit the people a a whole this include widen the base of ownership among others through the national empowerment fund south africa do not experience what others do because we have credible and sustainable fiscal and monetary policy combine discipline and flexibility despite the difficulty that we have experienced derive from the global economy we have resolve that we shall not cut the social spending require to build a well life for all include the poverty relief programme that now run into billion of rand while strict econometric model may require certain fraction for a balance among indicator we shall continue to discus realistic inflation target and interest rate for a develop country like ours we shall not divert from the course of discipline nor shall we a we say last year cut our nose in order to spite our face yet the public be within it right to ask if all be well why be the economy shed job be there hopeyes there be hope many of the initiative will take time to be felt in the life of ordinary people but there be immediate thing that can be do it be in recognition of this challenge that representative of government labour business and community come together last october to work out a concrete programme of action around this challenge of jobcreation and we emerge from there confident of the future because we set out to build it together among the decision take there some of them unprecedented in any country be firstly the proposal of the trade union movement to mobilise all work people to dedicate one day pay to the project meant to create job for our fellow citizen and today i commit all minister and deputy minister in my government to take part in this initiative by contribute a day gross salary we hope that all level of government include parliament a well a public and private institution will do the same secondly the mobilisation by the business community of fund which should run into more than r1billion for special project in tourism and skill development we can take tourism beyond the impressive 8 2 of gross domestic product that it have already achieve to create hundred of thousand of job over the next few year there will be a dramatic expansion of the exist r5billion government package of labour intensive programme such a work for water land care municipal infrastructure and select welfare project one major project on housing have already start where public and private fund will be pool to start a process that will speed up housing delivery at the same time a it creates job the umsobomvu trust which will be worth over a billion rand and which be aim at create job learnerships and business opportunity among the youth be one among project many of which have be propose by the youth themselves together these major initiative have the potential to change the face of south africa and if we say there be hope in so far a jobcreation be concerned it be because we know that all the partner have put shoulder to the wheel to ensure that we succeed in this context we should reflect on our achievement regard the regulation of the labour market i refer here to the labour relation basic condition of employment and employment equity act among others liberation could not have meant otherwise to a work class that be divide by racial law and section of which be block by edict from advance in the workplace we can not retreat from this achievement in human right that our trade union movement have initiate the kind of contribution to jobcreation that i refer to be testimony to the responsibility that go with a sense of social belonging notwithstanding these achievement if indeed jobcreation and end poverty be among our primary challenge we must continually evaluate how our labour market policy and the rate of private investment among others facilitate the realisation of these objective this we must do in order to ensure that we achieve our common objective this hope that we have about the future honourable member and delegate derives also from the knowledge that this government be serious about utilise state structure for the benefit of the people and this applies not only to the national sphere if in the past the profile of provincial government be portrayed more in the mistake they make it be perhaps a reflection of great improvement in their work in the context of south africa news content that little be heard about most of them in the medium we refer earlier to management of the matric result some improvement in the supply of textbook and the management of social security grant in addition to all this shouldnt we all be proud a south african that only two year after the introduction of mass allocation of fund to province we be able to achieve few overdraft and deficit this be not merely a stroke of good fortune it be a result of hard work and congratulation go to these public representative and administration last year we spoke of the need to cut expenditure on personnel a part of reduce a bloat civil service and change it orientation that commitment remains the new civil service regulation base on each individual output especially management rather than just observance of rule should see to the improvement of service to the public much progress have be make towards comprehensive agreement on redeployment and retrenchment logically this must be base on assessment of public need and on the very objective of governance but let u emphasise that none of the party in these negotiation will or should be allow to use these process to delay decisive action on this issue within local government there be steady progress in regularise finance in implement povertybased assistance in set up mechanism reduce the number of council and there be now seldom need for national intervention to resolve unnecessary conflict between these structure and traditional leader but we must be honest and acknowledge that in many respect this level of government have often played itself out a an achilles heel of democratic governance this be not for the lack of structure and rule where this happens it have more to do with the behaviour and attitude of cadre that all party have deployed in these structure it be a matter of the survival of democracy of the confidence that people will have in the new system that all of u should pay particular attention to this issue the public be justified in demand well service more respect and great concern for their need rather than selfaggrandisement our hope for the future depends also on our resolution a a nation in deal with the scourge of corruption success will require an acceptance that in many respect we be a sick society it be perfectly correct to assert that all this be spawn by apartheid no amount of selfinduced amnesia will change this reality of history but it be also a reality of the present that among the new cadre in various level of government you find individual who be a corrupt a if not more than those they found in government when a leader in a provincial legislature siphon off resource meant to fund service by legislator to the people when employee of a government institution set up to help empower those who be exclude by apartheid defraud it for their own enrichment then we must admit that we be a sick society this problem manifest itself in all area of life more often than not it be business people who launder fund to curry favour with public servant it be ordinary citizen who seek to buy themselves out of trouble it be strange religious leader who sing praise to criminal or hoard land acquire by the foul mean of apartheid all of u must work together for our redemption many mechanism have be put in place or strengthen to investigate and ensure proper punishment for these vile deed the public protector the heath commission the auditorgeneral the office for serious economic offence to name but a few within government more resource be be provide to allow them to do their work and very practical resolution emerge from the public sector anticorruption summit held last november by the time we go to the national summit in march which will be inform by the decision of the religious moral summit and the public sector conference all sector of society include business and the trade union movement should have work out concrete proposal to take this matter forward in a visible and meaningful way it be commendable that the public service bargaining chamber have this week agree on draft new disciplinary mechanism to facilitate deal with case of corruption mismanagement and incompetence our nation need a matter of urgency what one writer have call an rdp of the soul when we succeed in change our own way of do thing when we make progress in transform society at all level we shall not only be improve our own quality of life we shall also be lay the basis for a future of hope for our child and grandchild we know too well that if there be a problem of unemployment it be the youth who bear the brunt of it if there be high incidence of crime it be the youth who be misuse a footsoldiers and consumer of illegal substance if there be corruption and lack of morality it be they who suffer a warp upbringing if we do not rid ourselves of the culture of violence it be the youth who will be infect with it it be therefore encourage that youth organisation have start to play a more visible role in initiative such a the job summit and community service we value the increasingly powerful role they be start to play in the critical campaign against hiviaids they do have the capacity to make a special contribution to break the silence which fuel this epidemic a we shall all be do during the come national condom week when we focus on prevention this leadership role by the youth reinforces my own hope in the future of our country and our nation and i wish to all on all the youth of our country in their million to recognise their civic duty in all sphere of life include take part in exercise their right to elect a government of their choice madame speakeri refer at the begin to the letter write by a notorious prisoner in one of them he saidi be disturbed a many other south african no doubt be by the spectre of a south africa split into two hostile camp black on one side and white on the other slaughter one another by acute tension which be building up dangerously in practically every sphere of our life a i say earlier we have collectively manage the transition in a commendable manner but it be matter of public record that element of these division remain we slaughter one another in our word and attitude we slaughter one another in the stereotype and mistrust that linger in our head and the word of hate we spew from our lip we slaughter one another in the response that some of u give to effort aim at bettering the life of the poor we slaughter one another and our country by the manner in which we exaggerate it weakness to the wider world hero of the gab who astound their foreign associate by their selfflagellation this must come to an end for indeed those who thrive on hatred destroy their own capacity to make a positive contribution to the extent that the apprehension about the meaning of democracy relate to real fear about matter such a language and culture we be proud that progress be be make towards the establishment of the commission on these and other issue so that all can feel secure a part of a united nation to the extent that some of the apprehension be imagine or base on opposition to change to that extent we be convince that history will be the best teacher we hope though especially a we go into the election campaign that real leader will emerge who base their message on hope rather than fear on the optimism of hard work rather than the pessimism of armchair whine deal with these challenge also mean accept the fact of our history a i say when i receive the trc interim report last october the government accepts it with it imperfection we recognise that it be not a definitive or comprehensive history of the period it be review neither be it a court of law it be an important contribution on the way to truth and reconciliation the critical act of reconciliation to come back to the letter i refer to earlier be the dismantle of what remains of apartheid practice and attitude reconciliation without this major step will be transient the ode of false hope on the lip of fool it will therefore be critical that when we go into the detail of the trc report recommendation in the come period we must elaborate concrete plan about how together we can make practical contribution this applies particularly to reparation not so much to individual but to community and the nation a a whole let me reiterate that we shall all assist that process of nationbuilding and reconciliation reconstruction and development by protect the institution which guarantee the check and balance that make social and political aberration impossible our word of acknowledgement to the human right commission the gender commission and others for the sterling work they be do to strengthen democracy we should also underline that while it be a matter of design rather than accident that our social programme for the poor impact most significantly on the life of woman this be but a small element in deal with gender relation need we remind ourselves that the great number of violent crime that we have refer to take place in the home and mostly against woman need we remind ourselves of the various form of discrimination that still exist in the workplace school place of worship and other social activitybut we should also derive pride that never in the history of this country have any government do so much to improve the status of woman black and white and this with their active participationthe institution of the independent judiciary have be throughout these first year of our freedom be a fundamental pillar of our democracy and it continue to be it be matter of great pride that we have establish a dispensation in which noone not even the president be above the law and for this we owe thanks to the men and woman of integrity who serve in this institution another pillar of our democracy be the independent electoral commission and we respect it a we do all the others like all other such body it be be assist in various way in accordance with the mission set out in the constitution and what the country can afford i should indicate that after rational discussion agreement be reach that the iec should be allocate more than r160million in additional fund in the come budget year far to enable it to fulfil it function for the work that it have do to register potential voter the iec deserves our encouragement but it be you the citizen who have to come out voluntarily to register and take part in south africa governance we urge those who have not register to do so without delay democracy need your voice because of the impediment place before u by some of the party in this parliament i be unable to formally announce the election date it be the insistence that we retain the option contain in the constitution for premier to announce their own election date and not any reluctance on the part of the president that this matter can not be settle here and now i be however able to give the indication after extensive consultation that we aim to select a day for our second national election in the period between the 1 8h and 27h of may honourable member and delegatesif we dare ourselves to succeed in this endeavour it be because the benefit will be primarily ours but there be a sense in which it will be for all humanity the majority of whom take part in effort to help u achieve our democracy naturally southern africa be our most critical point of reference a we progress towards social and economic integration in the region we be guide by the need to reverse the legacy of our past in the form of a trade balance skewed in south africa favour the renegotiation of the southern african custom union and the progress towards a sadc free trade area slow a they may seem to outside observer be make progress along a path that be rneaningful and sustainable amongst the many concrete symbol of the integrate reconstruction of our region be the progress towards the establishment of a southern african electricity power pool coordinate from harare which will also augment the region power from the rehabilitate cahora bassa project these firm step towards integration be part of the renewal of our continent an african renaissance campaign which be grow to become a continental movement our celebration of the millennium must reinforce this campaign and draw our artist intellectual and journalist more actively into this enterprise sport event such a the africa game in great johannesburg this spring and the african cup of nation in zimbabwe next year should form part of this celebration of africa rebirth fundamental to our success in generate this rebirth be to root out the cause of conflict which be ravage part of the continent it be with great concern that we see angola once more threaten with allout war we do ask ourselves whether the time have not come to draw basic lesson from this experience to pose the question whether the united nation approach have be what be require of a situation in which one party reject the result of a free and fair election in the democratic republic of the congo we do welcome the grow realisation that political inclusivity in transition be one of the solution require there can be no winner in the military contest there can only be untold suffer to the african people far afield we remain hopeful that the protract conflict and the terrible suffer of civilian in country such a sierra leone somalia and the sudan will be brought to an end and look beyond our continent we join all humanity in call for a speedy resolution of the problem in the middle east and in east timor if i may i would like to say a few brief word on lesotho there be no doubt that sadcs collective initiative succeed in create the space for this country political leader to find a peaceful resolution of their difference and we ought to take this opportunity to congratulate the botswana and south african defence force on their decisive contribution and to pay tribute to those who lose their life we wish to assure member of our defence force that the nation be behind them in their endeavour be it in the fight against crime in peacekeeping operation or in their calm and professional assistance to voter registration we remain a commit a ever to equip the force in a manner that ensures it effectiveness and add value to the economy the building of our region and the renewal of our continent to which we have refer in turn form part of the broader movement of develop country to eradicate poverty and overcome the historical imbalance between north and south the successful nonaligned movement summit in durban last year have brought south africa the opportunity to assist in assert the interest of the develop world on serious issue face humanity amongst the most press of these be the debt burden a well a the need to bring under control the vast movement of capital which wash across the globe without much social benefit and with the capacity to undo year of industrialisation where it be most urgently need the initiative under discussion to manage these rampant effect of globalisation include unfair protectionist measure in some industrialise country require the reform of bretton wood institution and even more critically the united nation security council in conformity with the democratic ethos of our age we be encourage that more and more nation be start to recognise not only the need for this but it urgency a well we be proud a a country that over the last fourandhalf year we have broaden our relation with develop country of asia now the second large bloc with whom we trade a well a latin america across the atlantic our strategic location place u well to act a a bridge link these two important region and the african continent we scarcely need to add that this burgeon of our link with the country of the south be not in opposition to the our relation with japan the united state europe include russia or the new strategic partnership we be building with the people republic of china on the contrary they serve to enlarge the possibility for truly equitable partnership of mutual benefit to all our people for a country that not many year ago be the polecat of the world south africa have truly undergone a revolution in it relation with the international community the door of the world have open to south africa precisely because of our success in achieve thing that humanity a a whole hold dear of this we should be proud madame speakeras we reflect on the year of transition and beginning of transformation we have cause to draw inspiration from what south african can do we dare to hope for a brighter future because we be prepared to work for it the steady progress of the past few year have laid the foundation for great achievement but the reality be that we can do much much well in the discussion that i have have with deputy president mbeki we have pose to ourselves the question whether we should be satisfied with steady progress be south africa not capable of break out of the current pace and move much faster to a well lifeas the deputy president have often say the policy we have accord with the need of the moment there be no need to change them yet the speed and style of implement them can be improve there be a few ingredient to this that need far attention to elaborate on some of themthe first ingredient be partnership if we examine the major success that have be make this year in address the most serious problem we face one factor stand out above all others and that be partnership among various sector of society the job summit the new aid awareness campaign the summit on morality and corruption and the issue of security in the farm community be concrete example from recent month so too be last year successful masakhane focus week and it be in this spirit that we shall on freedom day announce this year winner of the president award for community initiative these initiative have result in major advance a society mobilises handinhand with government to tackle the issue head on a such one of the launch pad to faster progress have to be the mobilisation of south african society to act in unison on critical issue face the nation the second element be discipline the balance between freedom and responsibility quite clearly there be something wrong with a society where freedom be interpret to mean that teacher or student get to school drunk warder chase away management and appoint their own friend to lead institution strike worker resort to violence and destruction of property businesspeople lavish money in court case simply to delay implementation of legislation they do not like and tax evasion turn individual into hero of dinnertable talk something drastic need to be do about this south african society in it school and university in the workplace in sport in professional work and all area of social interaction need to infuse itself with a measure of discipline a work ethic and responsibility for the action we undertake thirdly and related to the above be the question of reconstruction of the soul of the nation the rdp of the soul by this we mean first and foremost respect for life pride and selfrespect a south african rather than the notion that we can thrive in senseless selfflagellation it mean assert our collective and individual identity a african commit to the rebirth of the continent be respectful of other citizen and honour woman and child of our country who be expose to all kind of domestic violence and abuse it mean building our school into community of learn and improvement of character it mean mobilise one another and not merely wait for government to clean our street or for funding allocation to plant tree and tend schoolyard these be thing that we need to embrace a a nation that be nurture it new patriotism they constitute an important environment for bring up future generation they be about the involvement of south african in building a well life thus we shall take not just small step but giant leap to a bright future in a new millennium a we confound the prophet of doom we shall defy today merchant of cynicism and despair we shall a we say in those letter of ten year ago fully dismantle apartheid and achieve true reconciliation our hope will become reality the foundation have be laid the building be in progress with a new generation of leader and a people that roll up it sleeve in partnership for change we can and shall build the country of our dream,5 February 1999,1999,Mandela

nation a a people determine to succeed place an obligation on u in fact to succeed today million of our people ask themselves the question how can i lend a hand in the national effort to build a well life for allduring our recent visit to new york to participate in the proceeding of the world economic forum we have the privilege to meet south african who live in or have become citizen of the united state these be marco piovesan who life in atlanta georgia and cathy gorille who life in seattle washington they and their friend all born in south africa have also be ask themselves the question how can we who reside in the united state lend a hand in the national effort to build a well life for all south africansfrom across the atlantic they have decide to make their own contribution to the common national effort by concentrate their resource and expertise in a programme for the reconstruction and development of our country correctly and interestingly they have entitle their programme vuk uzenzele which idiomatically might be express a arise and actthe call they have make applies to each one of u a we review a year in which we call for unity in action among all south african for change it be an abide challenge a we set out the programme of government for the come period on the occasion of our address to the joint sit of our two house of parliament last year we set out a programme of action focus on take u far forward on the road towards a well life for all our people the programme a far elaborate by minister in their address to parliament and their public briefing be concrete where possible we indicate the time frame within which particular action would be undertaken and so the time have come to account a few week ago we receive an unsolicited report from a team of academic at the university of stellenbosch lead by professor willie esterhuyse which comment on our government performance during the course of the year 2001 have study the programme government set itself at the begin of the year the team undertook a systematic analysis of what have be do to implement this programme this be what the team saysthe president make 43 promise in his speech by 8 january 2002 eleven month after the speech be make 65 of these have either be achieve or be credibly in progress 16 have not be achieve that give a ratio of 4 item of progress versus one item not yet complete on a far 19 we do not have sufficient information to make a call 65 v 16 be in our opinion a very good performance governance be not about push button and thing happen instantaneously various obstacle like inertia vested interest compete agenda lack of capacity and the like must be overcome from various speech and press release it be clear that minister be work towards the goal set by the president look at closely there be coherence and a sense of purpose and integration some of the 16 of item not yet achieve be those with a very large impact on the economy and society like the telkom ipo clarity on telecommunication issue and an effective campaign against aid we have take a hard line and suggest that these have not be achieve although government can certainly argue that they be in progress the team then explains why in it opinion thing do not look and feel well a they put it despite the progress that have be achieve in it view firstly this be because communication by government be not always optimum secondly it be because despite a lot of good progress on macro issue that be vitally important these be far remove from the person in the street we should also submit that look back at 2001 the very solid progress record have be overshadow by development in zimbabwe and around hivaids a government and even a member of parliament we may not agree with some or other part of these comment but there be no gainsay the fact that the analysis provide a fair assessment of government work in the past year and a the team say the national success be cause for celebration overall we should all be proud that steadily our country be move away from the past of racism poverty conflict and economic stagnation the weakness point out by the stellenbosch researcher reflect a variety of limitation in the structure and system of government that should be put right we can proffer a host of cogent reason for these and other shortcoming but to the extent that we have the capacity to do something about the problem we should and do take responsibility a government i would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude and thanks to professor esterhyuse and the team for an informative honest frank and dispassionate assessment of the work of government besides put the resource of the university at the disposal of the nation

sense this be the first session of the new parliament and allow me to take this opportunity to welcome member of the national council of province the living embodiment of cooperative governance their

service from their elect representative last friday i have the honour to thank our erstwhile senator for their service to the nation i wish to reiterate that today at the same time a they infuse the debate in these chamber with their unique knowledge and expertise they be also pioneer at an important moment of creation the culmination of which be national parliament a we have it today the major restructuring of parliament represent by these change epitomizes the mature of our democracy of no less significance be the process that lead to the adoption of the constitution include mass involvement on the one hand and the meticulous approach of the constitutional court on the other with each major judgment this court grows in stature and place our democracy on a high pedestal cooperative governance and the new patriotism also mean a loyal opposition an opposition that opposes but remains loyal to the constitution an opposition that take part in the major national programme to reconstruct to develop to reconcile to improve south africa stand in the world to enhance business confidence to put shoulder to the wheel in the fight against crime in brief an opposition that take full part in the effort to build a well life for all we be encourage that all party in this chamber have commit themselves to this national consensus through the new constitution we have laid the foundation for a peaceful and prosperous nation but it be just that a foundation and it will not amount to much if it provision be not felt in the daily life of our people we must and will popularise the constitution but above all we need to act together to implement it provision we can take pride madame speaker in the fact that a we enter the last half of this government mandate in ail matter of governance we have laid the foundation to move even more speedily to our nation goal we enter 1997 with all but one locality in the whole country enjoy democratic local governance the completion of this process during the course of last year be significant not only in the peaceful manner in which it be conduct but also because a new corp of leader have emerge in close touch with the people and steadily but surely start to make an impact on their life to improve the food security and nutrition of at least the most indigent of the population project which amount to r400million and reach over a million people be undertaken last year the primary school nutrition programme now benefit more than 3million child programme to develop new farm entrepreneur to return land to community and resettle others and to start tenure reform be start to change the face of our countryside over 700 000 people have already be supply with water and project be under way which will affect over 6million citizen after two year of prepare the ground the national housing policy be now fully operational today more house be in production than at any other time in south africa history million now enjoy the benefit of electricity arguably nowhere else be the fact of democratic transformation felt more keenly than in the area of universal access to health facility the building of clinic and hospital the immunisation programme and the beginning of a new drug policy all these and more be practical and new qualitative step that have transform the majority of south african from be neglect outcast into beneficiary of a compassionate health policy during the course of last year by dint of hard work by the health ministry the effort of relevant communitybased organisation and ironically the debate around one famous play the campaign against aid be more visibly put on the national agenda indeed it be in part because of south africa effort that we be invite to take part in the unaids meeting in davos switzeriand just this week for the first time in south africa history citizen be start to benefit from integrate human resource development represent by a nonracial education system life skill training financial support to student in tertiary institution supply side measure in industry to promote training and a sport programme base not only on the promotion of healthy lifestyle but also on construct facility in area that be hitherto neglect madame speakerwith the estimate 3 growth during the course of last year the south african economy have turn the comer towards consistent expansion beneath this figure which be of course less than what all of u would prefer be strong signal of a robust industrial revolution in the make this be reflect in the many megaprojects with investment of more than halfabillion rand each a phenomenal growth in fix investment and improve capacity utilisation in enterprise the physical volume of production be on a steep rise and so be our manufacture export the potential of the tourism industry have start to manifest itself and in the overall our balance of payment have start to improve we be hearten by the fact that small and medium enterprise can today boast of a government that not only promotes their interest but one that have in place the structure the procurement policy and the will to allocate resource to this sector be it in the housing programme the building of road the school nutrition programme and public work project these entrepreneur be gradually become a critical part of the economic mainstream we be confident that the new labour relation legislation so painstakingly set in motion during the course of last year will improve the management of this important area although no one piece of legislation can be a panacea to our deep social problem this new regime should temper conflict at the workplace and help strengthen the partnership between business and labour in national development despite exchange rate pressure our fiscal and monetary authority have perform extremely well to ensure that we meet the target budget deficit and improve the management of government finance in brief great progress be be make to implement the growth employment and redistribution strategy itself an achievement in integrate planning introduce last year another such achievement which be start to make a difference be the national crime prevention strategy despite the difficulty despite the fact that such achievement mean little to those who still experience crime the fact of the matter be that the offensive be on particularly with regard to most priority crime government be confident of make far progress in the fight for safety security and stability in this regard the role of the intelligence service deserves special mention these brave policeman and woman and intelligence operative have make a critical contribution behind the scene to the success that we have start to register we pay tribute to all these dedicate citizen who quite often put their own life in danger so that we can all lead safe and secure life indeed madame speaker we have laid the foundation for a well life this be what the reconstruction and development programme be about the rdp be alive and well it be not merely a sum of project but an integrate national programme to improve the nation quality of life but we would be less than candid if we do not acknowledge our shortcoming firstly because of capacity constraint some project could not be undertaken for instance a number of province have barely spent the fund allocate to them for housing and building of classroom it therefore do not make much sense to our people for u to decry the debt burden and lack of resource while we be unable to utilise even what we have secondly ordinary citizen continue to complain about practice that have not change in many government office corruption include the endemic problem of socalled ghost worker inherit from the past continue to bedevil the civil service thirdly the growth achieve last year be not sufficient to absorb entrant into the labour market lastly there be increase report of crime such a child abuse rape and domestic violence in some instance offender easily elude our criminal justice system because of a fragment and ridiculously backward data base we can list other example not to create despair but because we be determine to address these shortcoming this will be a major area of focus in our programme this year the primary consideration in this programme be the citizen for we can peddle figure of billion allocate to any project but the question be whether the fund have be spent and how they have benefit the citizen the people come first and our model strategy and plan should be measure by this yardstick in a nutshell the weakness we have identify boil down to three thing cooperative governance management and capacitybuilding in so far a local government be concerned there be nothing a urgent and a critical a the training of councillor their ability to raise fund and manage them to play their role in the multibillion housing and infrastructure programme to attract investment to deal with distortion of the apartheid era and to work with community in a partnership for development be skill that should be built more intensively this year at the same time amendment will be introduce to the local government transition act to help stabilise local government finance while provincial and national government will step in to assist where practicable progress in this regard will depend on the masakhane effort to build cooperation between community and their local representative closely related to the issue of local government be the matter of traditional leader in a number of area the social fabric of community have suffer because of conflict between elect structure and traditional authority we will this year intensify interaction with this institution and we hope to launch the national council of traditional leader within three month this year in keep with the spirit of the new constitution some of the recommendation of the finance and fiscal commission and consultation between national and provincial structure a large percentage of the national budget will be allocate globally to the province this step implies great responsibility and accountability on the part of the province intense discussion be take place between national and provincial executive structure in these consultation the vexed question of national minimum standard national priority national norm in spending and a rigorous common system of finance management be be thrash out and we be confident that there will be no major hiccup in the final analysis the question be not so much technically what power and right this or the other sphere of government have but what service we can perform and how well we should cooperate in meeting the mandate of building a well life for all closely tie to this be the question whether we be make any headway in transform the civil service to become a public service in fact i wish to congratulate the staff at all level for their effort during the try time of transition we have to land run and because significant achievement be make in social delivery an impression be create that we have found in place a civil service ready to implement the new policy from the experience of the presidential review commission it be quite clear to u that while work on longterm restructuring of the public service should continue immediate practical action be require to speed up the transformation from the investigation that the national ministry be conduct in the province task team will be sent to deal with such weakness a personnel record management of finance strategic planning and prioritisation information technology and labour relation what may seem simple and straightforward be precisely the thing that require thorough attention without this the danger be a stark a it be real that we shall not be able to meet the challenge of transform society the green paper on service delivery have be draft and the aim be to have legislation in place a soon a be practicable at the same time it have become critical to examine the question of government service which can easily more costeffectively and more efficiently be undertaken outside of government this have to be do with sensitivity with the interest of the citizen at the centre of our consideration i wish to assure the civil service that all these change will take place on the basis of consultation the historic agreement reach last year on a new salary and grade system be still in place like with all agreement there be condition apply to both side and government will strive to honour both the spirit and the letter of the agreement if and when a review be require this will be pursue on the basis of negotiation indeed if we do not restructure the service it will be difficult if not impossible to build on the foundation that have be laid we shall have good plan and even the resource to carry them out but we shall yearin and yearout be saddle with unspent fund terrible service and million siphon off in corrupt practice in callous disregard of the most vulnerable section of society madame speakerthe challenge in the area of safety and security derive also from similar weakness we need to ensure that when a crime have be prioritise that emphasis be felt throughout the whole criminal justice system we should this year establish a comprehensive data base improve the witness protection programme empower victim and introduce a new style of work with clear delivery target and deadline which must be met we be also put in place proper mechanism of coordination among the police the intelligence community and the prosecutor particularly on crime that be a national priority far within the framework of our commitment to the culture of human right government be grapple with the issue of bail and appropriate sentence for such serious offence a rape and murder associate with robbery legislation on these issue be be draft this be be do along with practical measure to improve the investigative capacity of the police let me warn the criminal especially the car hijacker the drug syndicate those who smuggle weapon corrupt personnel in the criminal justice system the rapist and child abuser and those involve in taxi violence we will continue to escalate the offensive against them we will make their life really difficult this year many of them have be identify and we have examine the way in which they have be evade the law we be closing in on them and we shall demonstrate convincingly that in our young democracy crime do not payin the near future we shall complete the investigation and take step to cut the number of commercial entry point into the country include some odd socalled international airport it be quite clear that the careless attitude of the day of third force destabilisation and sanctionsbusting be not only provide a heaven for criminal some of whom be part of these network but it be also plainly and simply a threat to national security however when ail be say and do success depends on our whole society adopt a new value system for in many way by buying steal good connive with unscrupulous businessperson to evade tax allow criminal to lord it over community we do become our own bad enemy we also become our own bad enemy by cooperate with force which commit crime such a murder and destruction of property in the name of campaign against gang and drug we must mobilise against crime yes but a partner in a lawgoverned society that respect our legitimate government and other citizen a lawgoverned society that do not tolerate illegal occupation of land and house a a result of the tireless effort of the police the intelligence community the national defence force a well a the affected community and political religious and business leader we have all but eliminate political violence for this all these sector and others must be commend yet with the kind of timing selection of victim and political rationalisation that be bizarre in the strictest sense of the word some individual decide a few week ago to use bomb to challenge our democracy we have examine these dark cloud and we be certain that the storm they threaten to bring have be avert let me reiterate that there be no reason at all for any of our citizen to seek redress through violence the avenue be there in the constitution and the structure it set out for air grievance it will be the height of folly for anyone to seek to provoke the patience of a people who have elect against their own deep emotion to forgive and to reconcile for their retribution will be decisive and tell honourable memberslet me take this opportunity to commend the truth and reconciliation commission for the magnificent work they be do to realise their mandate we do not expect their work to be easy and we be struck by the impact they be make on the national psyche for theirs be a process that hurt a much a it clean we be confident that they will be able to meet their deadline and we hope that the recent decision they and the freedom front persuade u to take on the amnesty deadline will assist in their work in this regard and in the interest of an inclusive process i take this opportunity to place before parliament the recommendation that the cutoff date for amnesty be extend to 10 may 1994 a it inch towards the truth the trc be help to seal the coffin of a heinous system and to unearth what remnant of the old network that may still be burrowing in our midst it be help to consolidate our democracy and thus to complement the magnificent work of the public protector the human right commission and other such institution another set of institution critical to the advancement of our society be the youth and gender commission we be confident that the youth commission will this year start to make it presence felt throughout society promote the interest of this precious asset to our nation after consider recommendation from parliament i have accepted the name put forward for the gender commission i wish to congratulate the chairperson thenjiwe mthintso and the other commissionersdesignate whose name will be make know in a medium statement during the course of the day let me also take this opportunity also to welcome the new chief justice of the land ismail mahomed and to assure him and the judiciary that we shall promote their independence and do our bit to make their work easy madame speakerwe have earlier note the progress in the implementation of our socioeconomic programme during the course of this year we

commit ourselves to within the department responsible for these programme the process of reorient spending and cost plan on a mediumterm basis will continue related to this be a delicate balance that need to be struck between two extreme on the one hand our tender procedure be either not suitable to current need or they be at time so rigidly apply a to become a break on implementation on the other hand there be instance where individual in authority have ridden roughshod over these procedure lead to unauthorised expenditure these procedure need to be review in line with the demand of transformation the confidence we have regard these socioeconomic commitment derives from the fact that our economic fundamental be sound this have give u a firm base from which to achieve high and sustainable rate of growth and development the government programme to facilitate this positive trend be guide by the critical signpost identify in our macroeconomic strategy namely growth in production for export infrastructural development restructuring of state asset reduction of the budget deficit human resource development and a comprehensive labour relation dispensation critical in all this be to create job and ensure equitable redistribution of wealth our programme this year include the implementation of the maputo development corridor initiative in term of road construction

critical part of our programme to attract investment and technology ensure efficiency guarantee affordable price and reorient state asset towards the goal of reconstruction and development in a matter of month besides the mammoth task of general restructuring telkom will acquire a strategic equity partner and sunair and aventura will be wholly privatise the airport company and safcol in forestry

1998 and intense discussion be under way in transnet to address these and other subsidiary all these step will be take in full consultation with all roleplayers and i wish to urge both management and worker to respect this principle our nation should be proud of a trade union movement that have take active part in the major national debate and along with business start to realise cooperative relation in the workplace and in nedlac but yet on both count the trade union movement face the challenge of unity across racial line take advantage of the opportunity that have open up and adapt fully to the challenge of the current phase on the other hand business have a long way to go with regard to such issue a equity in the workplace and reorient company to the developmental need of the moment we hope that this year negotiation on issue of basic condition of employment employment equity and the vexed question of a national social agreement will reach some resolution a indicate earlier we be equally optimistic with regard to issue of government expenditure during the course of this year we shall complete the plan towards mediumterm budgeting in order to bring budget allocation closer to our strategic objective and to speed up reprioritisation within department we shall also intensify effort to improve the government management of cash flow and eliminate

particularly the social requirement of the present and the future and the benefit that will accrue from bold decision the south african revenue service should be commend for the improvement in the tax collection system we be however concerned that many people be not meeting their tax obligation and a such the tax burden be borne by too few honest citizen it be fair to assume that we all want the programme outline above to materialise that we all want south africa to succeed but we must be prepared to foot the bill for success to broaden the tax base and break the culture of nonpayment we have offer certain relief measure which expire on 28 february this year all person who qualify be again urge to make us8 of this opportunity those who have not respond should be assure that after this will

be flawless the challenge be for the former statutory force to embrace change and to eschew the temptation to maintain the status quo it be for the former nonstatutory force to utilise the position they hold to help speed up transformation and not shy away from responsibility at the slightest hint of difficulty debate will continue this year on the white paper and the defence review but what be critical be to move towards practical implementation one of the issue in this regard be the defence force requirement for equipment the question here be not whether but how to meet these requirement and how much the country can afford a commanderlnchief i wish to emphasise that we shall not shirk our responsibility to the defence force we be confident that out of all these effort we shall

democracy and the reason it have endure be because we have be able to forge broadbased coalition and social compact be they with business labour special interest group or wider civil society achieve consensus and building social compact be a not demonstration of weakness it be the very essence of who we be that be why over the past two year we have be hard at work seek to forge and build

certain that this happens we have take the necessary step to ensure that the annual budget the minister of finance will present later this month make the necessary allocation to give u the mean to implement the apex priority the main category of these priority be the far acceleration of our economic growth and development speed up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social goal improve the effectiveness of our intervention direct at the second economy and poverty eradication enhance the impact of our programme target the critically important area of education and training accelerate our advance towards the achievement of the goal of health for all revamp the criminal justice system to intensify our offensive against crime far strengthen the

focus on some african issue and southsouth relation more than at any other time the situation that confronts our nation and country and the task we have set ourselves demand that we inspire and organise all our people to act together a one to do all the thing that have to be do understand that in a very real sense all of u together hold our own future in our handsas we act together everywhere in our country this we must also understand that what we have to be about be business unusualas i be prepare this address one among u suggest to me that our country be be buffet by strong crosswind that make it especially difficult to foresee where our country will be tomorrow he suggest that this morning to capture what he considers the essence of the reality confront u i should recall the wellknown word with which charles dickens open his novel a tale of two city and so i quote these wordsit be the best of time it be the bad of time it be the age of wisdom it be the age of foolishness it be the epoch of belief it be the epoch of incredulity it be the season of light it be the season of darkness it be the spring of hope it be the winter of despair we have everything before u we have nothing before u we be all go direct to heaven we be all go direct the other way in short the period be so far like the present period that some of it noisy authority insist on it be receive for good or for evil in the superlative degree of comparison only you will ask whether i agree with this assessment whether i too believe that we have enter an era of confusion in which all of u can not but lose our way unsure of our step unsteady on our foot fearful of the futuremy answer to this question be a definite no like the rest of our government i be convince that the fundamental that have inform our country forward march in the last 14 year remain in place they continue to provide u with the strong base from which we must proceed a we keep our eye firmly focus on the continued pursuit of the goal of a well life for all our people thus should we all reaffirm that we remain on course a we continue to strive to make ours a win nation however like all the honourable member i be aware of the fact that many in our society be troubled by a deep sense of unease about where our country will be tomorrow they be concerned about the national emergency into which the country have be thrown by the unexpected disruption in the supply of electricity they be concerned about some development in our economy especially the steady increase in interest rate food and fuel price which far impoverish especially the poor some among these worry about the possible impact on our own economy of the threat of economic recession in the united state they be worried about whether we have the capacity to defend the democratic right and the democratic constitution which be born of enormous sacrifice this be driven by such development a the prosecution of the national commissioner of police the suspension of the national director of public prosecution fear about a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law and the attendant allegation about the abuse of state power for political purpose they be worried about whether our country be threaten by the anarchy represent by the criminal torch of six passenger train in tshwane last month while they recognise and respect the right of the ruling party to regulate it own affair they be concerned that it must continue to play it role a one of the principal architect of a democratic nonracial nonsexist and prosperous south africa most obviously it would be irresponsible to ignore these and other concern or dismiss them a mere jeremiad typical of the prophet of doom the real challenge be to respond to them in a manner that conveys the definite message to everybody in our country and the million in africa and elsewhere in the world who watch our country with keen interest that we remain firm in our resolve to continue building the kind of south africa that have give hope not only to our people but also to many others outside our border let me therefore make bold to say that this historical moment demand that our nation should unite a never before and strain every sinew of it collective body to address our common challenge and keep alive the dream that have sustain all of u a we travel along the uncharted road towards the creation of the south africa visualise in our constitution the national emergency represent by the current power outage pose the challenge and present the opportunity to the entirety of our nation to give concrete expression to the call we have just make for all of u to unite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course this must say to all of u that we be indeed in a period of challenge but surmountable challenge and precisely because it be a period of challenge it be also an era of opportunityin this regard i would like to express our appreciation and full agreement with the comment make by the chief executive of anglo american cynthia carroll when she address the mining indaba here in cape town earlier this week on tuesday february 5 a the honourable member know she say i dont regard the problem of energy supply here a a disaster and south africa be not alone there be pressure on supply regard our expansion project in chile and brazil sure the problem here be serious overcome them will require ingenuity especially in energy efficiency and energy save a well a the development of alternative power supply but if all of u can forge strong partnership to tackle the situation we will all come through i hope relatively unscathedthis be not a time for finger point but for work together in find solution this have be say it be however also necessary that we take this opportunity to convey to the country the apology of both the government and eskom for the national emergency which have result in all of u have to contend with the consequence of load shed i would also like to thank all citizen for their resilience and forbear in the face of the current difficulty in the past two week the minister of mineral and energy and public enterprise have outline the nature of the emergency we confront and what each one of u can do to normalise the situation last week the honourable member have an opportunity to reflect on these matter in essence the significant rise in electricity demand over the last two year have outstrip the new capacity we have brought on stream the resultant tight supply situation make the overall system vulnerable to any incident affect the availability of energy in this situation we have to curtail the unplanned outage and the only way we can do this immediately be reduce demand and thus ensure a well reserve margin a government our task be to now lead and unite the country behind a campaign for energy efficiency that will address this challenge among other thing we must use the current adversity to ensure that our home and economy become more energy efficient there be concrete action each individual household and business can take these be be disseminate by the department of mineral and energy and we remain open to any other suggestion that you our compatriot may give to u and share with one another government will start implement a campaign to ensure efficient light solar water heating and geyser load management in household include housing standard for all new house and development we urge household that can afford to act immediately to consider implement these energysaving measure an instruction have be issue for all government building to reduce their consumption of electricity and please feel free to name and shame those who do not the detail of other voluntary and mandatory action in the power conservation programme have be set out by the minister and these will be refine through consultation with the various stakeholder and then publish on the supply side eskom be work furiously to ensure the introduction of cogeneration project a a matter of urgency we be take step to enhance eskoms maintenance capacity we have emergency task team deal with the challenge of coal quality and supply with the coal mining industry and we be work to fast track the approval and construction of gas turbine project all these action take together with the electricity save measure will improve certainty and raise the reserve margin the massive eskom build programme in new generation transmission and distribution capacity will continue and where possible some project will be accelerate in this regard i would like to thank the private sector for be prepared to assist in whatever way they can in a meeting with the chairman of general electric ge during the course of last week ge offer to assist by procure scarce turbine equipment on our behalf in south africa our own large company such a sasol anglo and bhp billiton be all in concrete discussion with the department of mineral and energy and public enterprise to find cost effective and sustainable solution to the supply constraint the approach be one of common action rather than recrimination i particularly want to pay tribute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assist u and the economy to resolve a real crisis that hit u on the 24th of january we will all work to minimise the adverse impact these event have on the industry collective effort and consultation be at the centre of our response to the emergency task team be currently work in many area

challenge the minister of finance will provide more information in the budget speech on the support that the government will provide for the energy efficiency campaign and to eskom in it build programme we face an emergency but we can overcome the problem in a relatively short period this situation have precipitate the inevitable realisation that the era of very cheap and abundant electricity have come to an end however give our large base of instal generation capacity for a long time to come ours will remain amongst the few economy with affordable electricity we be a mineral resource economy we must therefore continue to support the mining industry it be inevitable that if we be to continue on our growth path a a manufacturing country we will also have to continue support the processing industry however it be imperative that all enterprise become more energy efficient indeed energy efficiency itself provide economic opportunity let u therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building block of the essential energy efficient future we dare not avoid let u ensure that all hand be on deck to address the turbulence that have hit u inspire by the approach that our circumstance call for business unusualthis be exactly the same approach we must adopt a we continue to prepare to host the fifa confederation cup in 2009 and the 2010 fifa soccer world cup

of u face the task to respond to this historic challenge madame speakerin may last year in the aftermath of our third democratic election we set out the programme of action of government to achieve high rate of economic growth and development improve the quality of life of all our people and consolidate our social cohesion we do this confident that the progress we have make in the first decade of freedom provide the platform for u to move forward faster with well quality of output and well outcome in building a society that care with regard to the economy a recent report of the rand merchant bank prepared by the economist rudolf gouws saysreal domestic output growth accelerate through last year to reach an annualised 56 per cent in the third quarter a rate last see in 1996 with contribution come from all sector of the economy in term of economic growth south africa have long be underperform it emergingmarket peer group but the newfound high growth path be bring the country more in line with other successful emergingmarket nation the current economic upswing which begin in september 1999 be not only the long upward phase of the business cycle in the postwwii period but should also be sustainable into the future one of the reason be that the economy be in the process of change from one driven predominantly by consumption government a well a household to one driven to a great degree by fix investment a a consequence of the strong growth the employment picture in south africa have gradually begin to improve while south africa certainly still have a major unemployment problem there be encourage sign gouws comment on what he call government good trackrecord of implement prudent fiscal policy and continuesbut the improvement in overall government finance be not brought about primarily to please the financial market and the rating agency but rather to ensure that government be able to deliver service to the population in a sustainable way concurrent with the turnaround in public finance be important institutional change and improvement in the ability of government to deliver he concludes by say thatfaster growth couple with effort to improve the environment for do business and address the plight of the poor more effectively mean improve chance for a sustainable improvement in the general welfare of all south african we agree with the observation make by rudolf gouws indeed because of the factor he mention we have for instance with 90 coverage of most social grant almost met the objective we set for ourselves in 2002 of ensure that all who be eligible for these grant receive them within three year last december we pass the 10million mark in term of south african who have gain access to potable water since 1994 free basic water of 6 kilolitre per household per month be now be provide to about threequarters of household in the area of our country that have the infrastructure to supply potable water since 1994 close to 2 million housing subsidy have be allocate to the poor education remains our large single budgetary item with primary school enrolment rate remain steady at about 955 since 1995 and secondary school enrolment currently at 85 the gross annual value of the social wage be about r88 billion in 2003 with the poor be the large beneficiary the democratic state will not walk away from it obligation to come to the aid of the poor bearing in mind available resource in this context we must also refer to the late report of the unisa bureau of market research on national personal income of south african by population group income group life stage and lifeplane 19602007 among other thing this report say in 2001 41 million out of 112 million household in south africa live on an income of r9 600 and less per year this decrease to 3 6 million household in 2004 even after take the negative effect of price increase on spending power into account on the other hand the number of household receive a real income of r153 601 and more per annum rise from 721 000 in 1998 to more than 12 million in 2004 the additional social expenditure we have mention demonstrate what rudolf gouws be refer to when he say that the the improvement in overall government finance be brought about to ensure that government be able to deliver service to the population in a sustainable way on the other hand reflect on one element of the programme that we announce last may the issue of school infrastructure the editor of city press say correctly that the backlog of classroom still run into several thousand nationwide we believe that address the crisis in education be perhaps the most urgent priority the march deadline will not be met government must work out a plan that will ensure the speedy delivery of classroom to all overall our own detailed assessment of the implementation of our programme of action reveals that of the 307 concrete action contain in the government programme some of which we announce in the last state of the nation address51 of those with specific time frame have be undertaken or be be undertaken within the deadline we set21 have be or be be undertaken though there be slight delay in term of the time frame that we have set ourselves28 have not be fully carry out and the reason behind the delay be such that new deadline will have to be set for their accomplishment in other word 72 of these programme be be carry out within the broad framework of the time frame we have set ourselves 86 of the concrete action that do not have specific time frame be progress a envisage while 14 show some delay that call for urgent attention by government i wish to thank our colleague in cabinet the provincial executive and municipal executive council the public service a well a the leadership of our social partner who have put shoulder to the wheel to ensure that we carry out that which be expect of u jointly and severally to meet our common national objective we also highly appreciate the oversight role a well a the direct contribution in the crucible of actual implementation of our public representative in all the three sphere of government we be confident that honourable member will persist in this service to the people so a to improve our work allround what then be the programme of government for the year and how shall we build on the work do in the past decade in general and the past nine month in particularas honourable member will know the detail of the action in each of last year programmatic area have be publish on the government website i shall therefore only identify the major issue in term of our past work and then outline some of the thing that need to be do in the come year with regard to intervention to grow the first economy the broad objective we set ourselves remain the same we will continue our consultation with our social partner to ensure that our economy continue to steam ahead a rudolf gouws predict our programme for the come year be premise on the broad objective to increase investment in the economy low the cost of do business improve economic inclusion and provide the skill require by the economy therefore the

industry in particular to reach agreement on the issue of import parity pricing government have decide to avoid use legislation or regulation even in the face of these obvious market failure we believe that there be grow consensus among economic roleplayers with regard to what we be seek to do this be to ensure that work with especially the producer of input that be strategic for economic growth we find a resolution to this matter in a manner that address the interest of both these producer and the downstream industry bold step have be take far to liberalise the telecommunication industry we believe that the unacceptable situation in which some of our fix line rate be 10 time those of developed oecd country will soon become a thing of the past we also hope that the delay in set up the second national operator arise from legal process which be beyond government control will be resolve in due course and a soon a possible far work have be do to improve the work of define

government to improve integration among all sphere of government in both policy development and implementation the intergovernmental relation bill have be finalise and be await processing by the two house of our national parliament this will be complement by the alignment of spatial and development strategy and planning cycle among all the three sphere of government certainly it be a reflection of weakness in the governance system that the plan to build school infrastructure be unfold at a much slow pace than envisage the public sector a a whole can not claim to be such if the benefit of free basic electricity be accrue mainly to those who be relatively well off that only 56 of the municipal infrastructure grant have be allocate to municipality by december be a reflection of lack of allround capacity particularly in technical area with regard to water sanitation and public work project and the laborious decisionmaking process be not help either we can refer to the provision of service across all the sphere or weakness in the implementation of the urban renewal and rural development programme and the conclusion will be the same we need massively to improve the management organisational technical and other capacity of government so that it meet it objective in this regard the follow programme will be implement during the course of the come yearby may the forum of sa directorsgeneral will submit to cabinet a thorough review of the function of the government system a a whole and make proposal particularly on the capacity of the implement agent skill and competence

determine effort to educate our population that our country do not have the resource immediately to meet simultaneously all the admittedly urgent need of our people especially the poor all of u must understand the stark reality that even illegal violent demonstration will not produce these resource and will be met with the full force of the law at the same time we have to deal with those within the public service who because of their negligence and tardiness deny many of our people service due to them in instance where resource have be make available to deliver these service the programme to improve service through gateway and multipurpose community centre will be intensified by june this year the plan to improve monitoring and evaluation across government include the electronic

against the target that government have set itself we do hope that a part of their own contribution to the transformation of south african society and in the context of the obligation to meet the requirement of our law the private sector will do the same collectively we need to fight the tendency to act accord to particular stereotype described so succinctly by steven friedman an analyst at the centre for policy studiesin business and the profession too deeply pervasive prejudice decide who have ability and who not it be dress up a support for merit and it infests the think of many who believe genuinely that they be not prejudice and the effect in lose performance loss of selfesteem and anger from the thwart be much the same it may well cost u far more lose growth and achievement

1998_Mandela.txt,madame speaker and deputy speaker of the national assembly honourable chairperson and deputy chairperson of the national council of province honourable member of parliament distinguish guest lady and gentlemeni should start by express my appreciation for this opportunity to exchange view with you at the begin of this penultimate sit of our first democratic parliament i wish all of you a productive new year in the service of the people a government we be confident of the progress be make to meet our mandate we be resolve to build on the solid foundation that have be laid over the past threeandahalf year a always the most critical challenge be whether we be succeed a leader to mobilise the people in actual practice to be their own liberator we know too well that on our own we can not succeed we know that the programme of government be not the panacea for all the ill of our terrible past they be but a platform for south african to let their strength shine through by our own pronouncement and action we could relate to these citizen a passive recipient of government delivery a if government be a force on high bad still we could turn some constituent into passive critic their own rationality drown in the chorus of regret that the past have pass on both count this would be a recipe for sure failure that be why during the course of last year we once again put the masakhane campaign at the centre of our activity and our performance should be judged above all on the basis of whether our programme be positively affect the life of especially the most vulnerable section of society the poor woman the disabled child and the rural mass the primary victim of the iniquitous system from which we have just emerge we be proud to answer this question in the affirmative last year we increase the supply of clean and accessible water from 700 thousand to 13 million south african we have surpass our plan to build or upgrade 500 clinic last year and the primary school feed scheme reach 49million child from 250 thousand in 1996 we be in line to make 421 thousand telephone connection this financial year make life that much easy for million of south african with more than 400 thousand electricity connection in 1997 alone today south africa have reach a 58 electrification level so million can have light besides the impressive land redistribution programme the law on secure tenure will bring more certainty in the life of over six million citizen there be no magic in number a such but we be proud that through these and many other project our programme be impact on the life of particularly the poor this applies to vary degree with regard to other challenge to which we shall later return and it be all a result of a clear strategy properly manage plan good governance and more than anything else the determination of the overwhelm majority of our countryman and woman to change their life for the well it be therefore understandable that unlike some of u those who bore the brunt of apartheid oppression say that thing be a lot well but they also say and be justified to say so that what have be do be not enough not because they expect the legacy of century of colonialism to be eradicate in a few year a we ourselves have say on countless occasion before not because they be frustrate with government but because they appreciate that together we need to much more over many year to realise a truly just and prosperous government they have a serious commit and care institution a government that they can call their own we be at the begin of an arduous and protract struggle for a well quality of life in the course of this struggle we shall have immediate success we shall have setback but we shall certainly progress inch by inch towards our goal from time to time incident do happen which bring out in bold relief the enormity of the challenge we face a the say go one fall tree make more noise than million that be grow a such for both good reason and bad occasional problem be seize upon by our detractor a the stockintrade of this government indeed a the essence of democracy i will raise a few of them particularly difficulty with regard to old age pension education crime and corruption housing and jobcreation because they touch on the very essence of the issue of resource to meet our obligation the size of the public service and it management civic duty and a new morality madame speakera few week ago the problem of disbursement of old age pension and other social grant come to the fore let me start off by say that in the way that we increase old age pension last year and a we eliminate fraud we shall seek to find resource this year for a far increase modest a it may be work towards a life of dignity for our senior citizen let me far emphasise that we be commit not merely because of statutory obligation but because we care to ensure that whatever the occasional administrative hiccup the right to a pension will always be met what have not receive much public coverage be the fact that the problem we experienced recently derive from firstly that the audit of our newly integrate system be not only eliminate ghost but it also identify people who be callously refuse these pension under the apartheid system and it bantustan offshoot they be today on the roll and it be decide that their right to backpay could not be disregard secondly the measure that have be take to eliminate corruption have uncovered many fraudsters in the government machinery but we still have a long way to go to resolve this problem thirdly some public servant be to put it mildly not imbue with the spirit of public service to the extent that even in instance where these fund be available they do not turn up on time andor they relate to senior citizen with attitude bordering on the criminal through cooperation between national and provincial movement concerned we shall ensure that these problem be dealt with methodically and with a ruthless determination related to this we do indicate last year that we expect some teethe problem in the first year of total budget allocation to the province indeed we need to pause here to pay tribute to the provincial administration which be able to come through without debilitate desolation give the serious problem identify by central government task team last year it be thanks to the effort of all province without exception that the problem have not be much bad but we must eliminate overspend a related and critical matter be the issue of how the public resource at our disposal correspond with the social backlog that we have inherit in our view the start point in address the question of the national budget and public finance in general be that we can not behave like fool who cut their nose to spite their face to throw policy out of the window in search of fraction of percentage in deficit target we have creatively to strive to meet our obligation within the context of a reduction of the public debt indeed we can not pretend that the deficit target we have set ourselves do not test our capacity and will but we can not divert from the course we have chosen there be no other route to sustainable development two critical matter arise from this in the first two year of our democracy we sought to use the special mechanism of a socalled rdp fund to lever change in the pattern of departmental spending today this task be built into the normal function of all department reprioritisation and more reprioritisation be the challenge that we shall continue to grapple with in the come year for if we should not and can not cut down on house and clinic be built on the supply of water on improve the quality of education include the building and equip of school on improve police and so on then we have to cut down elsewhere there have be some commendable saving from well cash flow management but it be not nearly enough and we can not use the proceeds of privatisation to fund salary and other consumption expenditure put in simple term we need to cut spending on personnel i be confident that all of u and the trade union movement in particular will agree that apartheid south africa be overgoverned and oversupervised the size of the public service have nothing to do with public service on the other hand democratic governance be management of a process whereby people govern themselves government be not an employment agency this year we shall go into this question without equivocation frankly put we shall need to start comprehensive discussion with the union on retrenchment in accordance with the provision of our labour law these negotiation will need to take into account the principle that shed job in the public service do not necessarily have to translate into worsen the problem of unemployment for instance retrenchment package that include investment capital and tender obligation on the part of government can in fact help expand the job market especially in depressed rural area we shall a a matter of urgency require our public service department and province to work out proposal in this regard job job and job be the clarion call that should guide u we do pride ourselves with the health of our economic fundamental the decline rate of inflation the incentive that we introduce which have attract over r7billion in investment close on to 400 project related to spatial development initiative such a the maputo corridor which have attract investment to the tune of about r77billion the rise graph of productivity and increase export with regard to the budget we have introduce transparency and certainty through the mediumterm expenditure framework and tax collection be improve a more people be brought into the net we can quote many more example include a relatively stable exchange rate in the face of global adversity and the hundred of thousand of job create through the public work municipal infrastructure and investment promotion programme but the economy continue to shed too many job this be in part because the rate of investment particularly by ourselves a south african be not enough within an overall increase in fix investment of about 3 public authority show a massive decline in the ratio of growth of capital expenditure public corporation be do much well and they need to be commend for this the rate of growth of productive private investment have not be impressive a such we should all agree that the issue be not merely one of government create a favourable environment to attract investment this it have do with commendable determination what be require be a deliberate effort to increase investment the type of investment which create job these be the thing i be told that the various sector in nedlac be address in preparation for the job summit by the time of this summit we hope that a real partnership will have emerge among government business and labour to tackle this critical task one will not be exaggerate to say that give it impact on everything else we do a a nation include crime prevention reconciliation and the very survival of our democracy the job summit be perhaps the most important event since our first democratic election an important launch pad for a determine national drive a we move into the 21st century it be quite clear that a we finalise preparation for this summit we can not continue to imprison ourselves in the paradigm of large profit and only large profit a the drive force of business operation we can not continue to wallow in the illusion that the protection of the narrow interest of the employ be the drive force to poverty alleviation we must launch joint effort towards an economy that creates job towards a society that care by help the unfortunate in it rank to help themselves honourable member and delegateswithin the context of facilitate economic growth transfer of technology and black empowerment we have make great progress in the programme to restructure state asset a we promise a the last opening of parliament the previous year have see telkom acquire strategic partner sunair have be privatise south african airway be complete it restructuring towards acquire a strategic partner while the airport company and safcol process be take longer than anticipate they be on their way to completion this year the pace in the restructuring programme be broadly in keep with our set time frame where difficulty have be experienced they represent lesson both about our past and our present with the aventura holiday resort for instance a government of the people could not ignore the complex land claim that be attach to some of these resort with alexkor in diamond mining we once again learnt that much information about the net worth of many state asset have be conceal by those who ran the previous government or they simply do not care about these asset but we be on course to resolve the problem i wish once more to reiterate that for u the issue of restructuring of state asset be not driven by ideology we shall privatise where necessary but we shall also set up new state enterprise where market imperfection and failure play themselves out to undermine social programme such be the case with element of the liquid fuel industry and the service of housing construction which have not receive the optimum support from the banking industry restructuring also mean strengthen management of exist enterprise a programme that we have intensified on the issue of housing in particular it be necessary to go back to the basic the number of close on to 400 thousand subsidise house either complete or under construction and about 700 thousand subsidy allocate be important indicator of progress but a we indicate earlier there be no magic in number a such and the target of 1 million house in five year provide directly by government may not be attain what we need to examine closely be whether after the delay in the launch of the housing programme in 1994 we have muster the capacity to accelerate this programme and the answer be yesthe pace of housing construction be accelerate today one thousand house be start or complete every twoandahalf day and a a result of our programme 12 million south african have a permanent roof over their head in consultation with some of the bank we have clear hundred of socalled redline area we have ensure over 60 thousand loan at the upper end of the subsidy market many constructor have be register monitoring of quality and the capacity of province have be enhance in addition to issue of quality question have also be pose about the size of house that be be built go back to the basic here mean appreciate that government be focus on the poor and most vulnerable sector of society if we have to reach the wide spectrum of these citizen with the resource available we can not increase the size of the subsidy in addition to service and a plot of land that family can call their own possibility be left for them to exercise initiative with the resource available and to improve the basic structure when they be in a position to do so indeed among the proudest moment of this programme be the involvement of the people themselves especially woman who through their own labour and creativity be able to achieve much more with less in consultation with local government we have also start to examine in great detail the question of density integrate development and rental accommodation in brief whatever the difficulty and initial delay in the first five year we be on course to ensure that in the end there shall be housing and security for all honourable member and delegate will agree that significant progress have be make in transform education include adult basic education from the mess it be under apartheid today child start their school can for the first time do so just a child not a black piccanini or a white kleinbaas from the selfcriticism last year about the schoolbuilding project we be happy that province have start to use more of the fund set aside for this purpose but a in other area there have be moment in this sphere which bring to the public mind the enormity of the task that we face such be the matric result of last year it be encourage that in typical south african style after the brief flurry of accusation and counteraccusations we start to focus attention on the real issue among these issue be the fact that the standard of the paper be somewhat high and security of exam somewhat tighter most inconsequential subject take in the past simply to fill a certificate be do away with the mark be more rigorous and there be minimal adjustment of the mark a such though ironic to say there be few but well pass this be not to detract from the fact that we have only scratch at the surface of the legacy of apartheid education many child still study under tree and dilapidate building many school be hollow shell without even the most basic equipment for normal teach many teacher do not have the capacity to transmit knowledge in a professional manner and some simply do not see it a their civic duty to relocate to area in need there be inexcusable and unacceptable delay in the supply of textbook which derive from poor management and shoddy tender deal let alone the nonexistence of malfunction of many school govern body yet when all be say and do many school in disadvantage area have show that serious application to duty by the school authority and the student can bring positive result we pay tribute to these hero madame speakerthis spirit of community of partnership and of hard work be require when deal with problem of crime and corruption again in this area the tendency often be to exaggerate and distort the real situation to use halftruths and sensationalism to paint a picture of a situation out of control it be understandable that unscrupulous politician medium commentator and those who wish to question the legitimacy of the democratic process a such will conjure up crisis in the head where in reality there be no crisis the task of those interested in improve the country quality of life be to examine the real situation in it complex form even if this may not please the prophet of doom that reality be that since 1994 there have be a marked decline in virtually all serious crime such a murder robbery taxi violence carhijacking and others in other word since this democratic government come into be there have be a decline in most serious crime this be a result of well coordination among all arm of the security service the police the intelligence service and the defence force a well a cooperation across southern africa one such example of effective coordination be in the farm area where there be an 80 success rate in apprehend the murderer the national crime prevention strategy have get off the ground and a we promise last year the law on bail and mandatory sentence for serious crime have be pass a detective academy interestingly the very first one in the history of south africa have be open to improve police investigative capacity and skill to do their job proposal on reduce commercial entry point include closing some socalled international airport have be finalise and we hope that we shall receive the cooperation of all affected party despite the formal agreement that they may have enter into with the previous government among the element which know how effective the security force be become be the crime syndicate themselves it appear that from time to time and not seldom during crucial political moment they will engage in dramatic act such a robbery of cashintransit syndicate turf war and prison escape but they know well than any politician that the net be closing on them that the intelligence service be on their heel even if it may take time to build watertight case against them that wherever they may be hiding even in the police and other state structure in the private security company among prison warder and even the legal fraternity that even if they may form a web of political force bent on destabilise our young democracy they know that their day be numbered the same should be say about corrupt element who see public service a an opportunity for selfenrichment mechanism be in place and be be improve all the time to root them out in this regard i wish to thank the medium for it vigilance while there may be instance where finger be point at individual without justification there be a good many example where investigative journalism have help u uncover the scoundrel old and new who prey on the public purse to find a last solution to all these challenge require a community spirit among all of u a new patriotism which be find root within the populace we must build our nation into a community of citizen who appreciate their civic duty a each one of u improves our wellbeing we must be ready to give back to society part of what we gain from it in this respect the word of one eminent citizen who have actively join the campaign against crime be worth repeat in this august assembly this country wart and all have be good to me it be unbelievable it have fed me it have clothed me it have educate me it have give me opportunity in the business world that be unthinkable when i be a kid in brit i think the very least i could do be put something back and this be my kind of national service and i be enjoy it this be a challenge to all of u especially those whose past privilege have afford them skill that be in high demand in public service to volunteer skill to help improve the lot of the nation indeed on the vexed question of crime we could do more if each south african of integrity consciously ask themselves everyday whether they may have assist in the commission of crime a a parent who conceals the activity of a child who be take drug without assist the police to track down the supplier a a customer who cooperates in a transaction which allows you a large discount because the seller will not pay vat a a trade unionist or ordinary worker who turn a blind eye to pilfer on the shopfloor or bad still to corruption in government service a a politician who stand behind individual who break the law in the name of challenge body such a the truth and reconciliation commission a a parent or spouse who avoids ask question when a relative be suddenly awash with money and behaves like a fugitive from justice dont many of u do this and more and yet express bewilderment at the high rate of crime what this emphasis be that we need a campaign of moral regeneration a we reconstruct the material condition of our existence we must also change our way of think to respect the value and result of honest work and to treat each law of the country a our own this be our call to all south african to firm up the moral fibre of our nation it be a call to artist and musician and sportspeople to religious leader and traditional institution to intellectual to the medium and to all those who should give leadership a we establish new symbol and role model all of u to join hand in a new patriotism not because the government say so but because it be in our common interest to do it in this regard it be encourage that the youth of our country through the national youth commission have take important step to define a youth policy that will give all irrespective of the skin colour that be the accident of birth a stake in our new society particularly hearten be the proposal for youth community service which can be broaden to encompass most of society be it in help to clean street volunteer service in school and so on civic duty be the central purpose behind the masakhane campaign whose awareness week last year be fairly successful we shall continue this year and beyond to intensify this drive include the mobilisation of and assistance to nongovernmental and communitybased organisation who truly have the interest of the community at heart honourable member and delegatesit be to promote the spirit of masakhane that we set up the president award for community initiative this annual award honour those who roll up their sleeve and take the initiative to uplift their condition we be privileged today to have with u a guest of the president representative of the nine community that be the first provincial winner select from some two thousand entry they embody the unquenchable determination of south african to well their own life we recognise the buhlebemvelo garden project from kwazulunatal the ikgodisent sew project from huhudi the malungeni training and development centre the bekkersdal flagship project for unemployed mother the dassie preschool centre from oudtshoorn the khotsong branch of the homeless people federation the nkomazi farmer association the hantam community education trust and finally the project which be yesterday announce a the national winner of the president award for community initiative the mhala development centre in the northern province set up by retrench mineworker work with their union and their former employer our congratulation to those whom you represent and indeed to all the 54 runnersup may the financial prize from government strengthen your effort and may your example inspire others to seek this honour in future year there be also countless others outside the limelight who deserve our admiration and gratitude such a school principal mr mandla hlatshwayo of ndwedwe in kwazulunatal who brave a rag river during torrential rain to deliver matric examination paper to his student the security guard who risk life and limb singlehandedly to hold highway robber at bay lead to their arrest the many sportspeople and other citizen who make u proud to be south african this multifaceted effort to build our society on the basis of a new morality demand that we should be open about mistake that we commit in the past such be the importance of the truth and reconciliation commission because these mistake be commit by u so will their air in public be hurtful and at time embarrass but the more we know about how low we once sank the more difficult it will be to repeat these mistake at the hearing of the trc over the past year many horrid detail emerge we can not fail to have be move by the remorse of some perpetrator and the preparedness of victim to forgive we can not fail to have be astound by their very modest appeal for their dignity to be restore but this should not be surprising for their suffer be not for pecuniary gain but for the great prize of freedom and a well life for all the government have heard the appeal for urgent reparation and we shall be ready to provide modest assistance when the detail have be forward a part of the multiyear budget account will be take of the need within our limited resource and we hope that those who benefit from the suppression of others will find it within themselves to make a contribution a the trc move towards finalise it work we shall do our best to ensure that their need be provide for but we know too that this will not be the end but the begin of the process of reconciliation it be quite unfortunate that some among u still refuse to cooperate with the trc give that part of it task be to unmask the network that not only violate human right but also form one web with crime syndicate the question will haunt such force forever why it be that they continue to conceal this information we need to make it clear that those who cringe at the bank of the rubicon of truth those who serve in state structure and refuse to apply for amnesty will not be assist by the state in the face of whatever consequence accrue to them from their past related to this be the danger of any political leadership and medium to continue with the campaign of exploit the fear uncertainty and anxiety of certain community about the transition the clamour among some party to outdo one another in this regard be counterproductive to say the least it worsens polarisation and stokes the fire that have the potential of consume all of u in any case it be pointless because it will not stop change transformation be this government reason for existence and we shall not for a moment shirk our responsibility to the poor this government be humane and we know that the wellbeing of those previously deny their right be the sure guarantee for the wellbeing of all it be for this reason that it pain me personally when i listen to some of the debate in this chamber always a clear distinction emerges between those who be at the cut edge of the struggle for freedom who strive for change and those who implement of benefit from oppression who seek to block transformation in defence of a modify form of the old order i should take this opportunity to pay homage to the institution charge with the task of enhance our democracy and culture of human right if we say with confidence that south africa will succeed it be in part because we know there be a constitutional court the public protector the human right commission the electoral commission which have start it challenge work and the auditorgeneral all of which will assist in ensure that what we do be not only constitutional legal and legitimate but that it be see to be so by all and sundry include the weak among u a word of congratulation to the gender commission which have start it work to ensure that our society be true to the principle of consistent equality in everything we do yet this commission and the office on the status of woman should not be see a watchdog of an alien force bent on do wrong rather society a a whole should see them a part of our joint effort a men and woman to liberate themselves from gender prejudice we be also encourage by the systematic work be do regard the position of the disabled what matter be not merely the thousand of wheelchair hearing aid and ten of thousand of cataract operation provide in the past year alone but also ensure that the attitude in employment practises in discourse in design of infrastructure and more all these should be change with the participation of the disabled themselves this year we shall ensure the intensification of the effort regard multilingualism in government work and we should thank the pansouth african language board for it vigilance far after extensive consultation during the course of last year we be a step closer towards the set up of the commission for the promotion and protection of the right of cultural religious and linguistic community madame speakerour programme for this year will once more seek to speed up the improvement of the life of all with particular emphasis on the most vulnerable and needy some of the additional highlight of this programme whose detail will be announce by the various ministry during the course of next week includeour commitment to meet our budget deficit target a we far improve the efficiency of tax collection a the far step we take recently indicate we shall continue on a casebycase basis to lift exchange control a condition for such mature construction start on many maputo development corridor project two new development initiative in the cape west coast and northern kwazulunatal will be launch in the first half of the year work start in the west to complete the highway across south africa from maputo to walvis bay the basic economy be be revolutionise the integrate tourism programme will be launch in earnest with the potential to create 300 thousand job by the turn of the century in the workplace the departure from apartheid practice will be felt even more keenly a we finalise and implement the bill on employment equity and let u hasten to add in this regard that we shall not be discourage by the siren of selfinterest that be be sound in defence of privilege and the insult that equate woman african indian coloureds and the disabled with a lower of standard a we have say before affirmative action be corrective action there be no other way of move away from racial discrimination to true equality we therefore reject campaign which be base on fear rumour and gossip special attention this year will be paid to the far consolidation of local government with it critical contribution in area of infrastructure jobcreation small business development and the very legitimacy of democracy we should also take this opportunity to acknowledge local government delegate present her and with them celebrate the begin of their full participation in the national council of province and intergovernmental forum the white paper and new legislation on local government which should be finalise this year will help streamline this sphere of government without derogate from representivity and accountability and to start meeting the requirement of the constitution in the context of poverty alleviation over r3 billion will this year be equitably and directly allocate to this sphere of government a we attend to these matter particular attention will be paid to continued dialogue with traditional leader so a to ensure that all of them become full and active partner in the struggle for local development this year also see the launch of the new government communication and information service which we be certain will contribute to the challenge to improve communication among south african to afford citizen their right to information and to

metropolitan area which account for the bulk of violent crime be be finalise for immediate implementation let u once more underline to those who choose to live a life of violent crime that a recent incident regard cash heist have show we shall with the combine might of the security service return fire with overwhelm fire this year we launch the programme that will streamline the judicial system so a to alleviate overcrowd in prison without create any new danger to society above all we shall appoint the national director of public prosecution and provincial counterpart a first in the history of our country within the intelligence service it have become even more urgent to unearth the few rotten apple who arrogantly pursue an agenda counter to transformation to put it mildly they be an affront to our security and our pride a a nation they be a blight on the commendable work that these service be do to defend democracy we be proud that after a year of so of healthy and informative

and lusaka zambia while opening what prove to be parcel bomb sent by agent of the apartheid system these be onkgopotse tiro a leader of the south african student organisation saso and adolphus mvemve then chief representative of the anc in zambia i be very pleased that they be able to join u today nelson mandela deliver our first state of the nation address before the first democratically elect parliament on the 24th of may 1994 in that address he quote from a poem by ingrid jonker in that poem ingrid jonker saidthe child be present at all assembly and lawgivingthe child peer through the window of housesand into the heart of mothersthis child who only want to play in the sun at nyangais everywherethe child grown to a man trek on through all africathe child grown to a giant journeysover the whole worldwithout a passnelson mandela then go on to sayand in this glorious vision she instructs that our endeavour must be about the liberation of the woman the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child it be these thing that we must achieve to give meaning to our presence in this chamber and to give purpose to our occupancy of the seat of government and so we must constrain by and yet regardless of the accumulate effect of our historical burden seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our share destiny the government i have the honour to lead and i dare say the mass who elect u to serve in this role be inspire by the single vision of create a peoplecentred society accordingly the purpose that will drive this government shall be the expansion of the frontier of human fulfilment the continuous extension of the frontier of freedom the acid test of the legitimacy of the programme we elaborate the government institution we create the legislation we adopt must be whether they serve these objective today we begin the last session of our second democratic parliament we begin this session twoandhalf month before we celebrate our first decade of liberation and democracy we also meet in these house of parliament not long before we hold our third general election it be therefore natural that our national legislature should spend some time reflect on what we have achieve and not achieve during the last ten year inevitably all of u will also make speech aim at improve our fortune in the forthcoming election but perhaps the correct start point for the government would be to recall what be say a we begin our journey into our democratic future it be for this reason that i quote what president mandela say at the start of the first session of the first democratic parliament to repeat what he saidthe government i have the honour to lead and i dare say the mass who elect u to serve in this role be inspire by the single vision of create a peoplecentred society accordingly the purpose that will drive this government shall be the expansion of the frontier of human fulfilment the continuous extension of the frontier of freedom the acid test of the legitimacy of the programme we elaborate the government institution we create the legislation we adopt must be whether they serve these objective sometimes it be difficult fully to understand the fact that we be barely ten year away from a time in the life of our people when our collective future be very uncertain some among u will hardly remember that even a we met in this house to listen to president mandela deliver the state of the nation address fellow south african be continue to die a a result of political violence for instance the south africa yearbook 1995 report that although political violence decline during and after the april 1994 election extensive criminal and political violence continued to persist in the country especially in kwazulunatal and on the east rand of the gauteng province daily fatality from political violence still numbered six in may and just under four in june others among u will have forgotten that a we sat here listen to that first state of the nation address the commitment make by president mandela to ensure the expansion of the frontier of human fulfilment be to many little more than a promise they appreciate but could not fully comprehend the question have still to be answer a to where the resource would be found to finance the expansion of the frontier of human fulfilment of which president mandela spoke in the decade up to the middle of 1993 the average annual gdp growth rate be less than 1 per cent during the first half of 1995 the annualised growth rate stood at 1 per cent for the fiscal year 199495 the budget deficit stood at 6 6 per cent consumer price inflation in the 12 month up to april 1995 be 11 per cent by the end of that year the interest rate stood at 13 per cent on 14th of february 1995 the then governor of the reserve bank chris stals say a more restrictive monetary policy be need to make sure that the current economic upswing will not be of the boombust nature of earlier time but will be more durable on the 29th of june of the same year mr stals sound an ominous note when he say underlie inflationary pressure be undoubtedly increase again in the south african economy if left unchecked this trend will eventually force the abortion of the welcome improvement over the past year in real economic growth and will frustrate the objective of the reconstruction and development programme on the 28th of august 1995 chris stals say basically the south african economy be not competitive enough to enable it to maintain an economic growth rate at a level high enough for it own need more drastic economic restructuring will be need to lift the growth potential of the economy to the desire and more acceptable level in the same speech he express the uncertainty of the day when he say economic growth will in the final situation be dependent not only on an improvement in the economic structure of the country but even more so on political and social stability in the final situation all business decision be influence by the overall environment in which they be take on the 12th of october 1995 he say that the country be still face with some political uncertainty which impact on our economic prospect he saidat this stage the country still have to facethe first fully democratic election for local authority schedule to take place in early november this yeara more clear definition of the political economic and financial relationship between the central government and regional government andthe draft of a final constitution to replace the current interim constitution before the next general election can take place since time immemorial the overwhelm majority of our people have know nothing but despair they knew this a an incontestable matter of fact that tomorrow would not be well than yesterday it be also fix and give that the follow day would be bad but then april 27 1994 come and thing change radically and irrevocably for all south african for the black and especially african majority suddenly a new dawn broke after these mass have cast their vote they still have nothing in their stomach and their pocket they walk away from the polling booth to return to their miserable shack their child make listless by hunger and the brutish thug who prowl the unlit dirt road of the shantytown ready to pounce on their victim with no sense of mercy they walk the long distance to return to their homestead of rural squalor to the morning of the drudgery of woman with bucket full of dirty river water on their head to the daily diet of mealiepap to the dark still and menace night broken only by the weak flicker light of the paraffin lamp and the die ember of an exhaust fire on the humble hearth but yet they have a spring in their step because they knew that a new dawn have proclaim the come of a bright day though their hand carry the emptiness to which generation of deprivation have accustom them their heart and mind be fire up by a newfound sense of hope and the attendant feel of dread l that hope turn out to be but a mere mirage the false creation of a wish that be intensely felt the experience of many decade have taught u to understand that the black poor of our country value a just peace a deeply a they value their life it have taught u that their sense of pride in themselves a human being make it impossible for them to join in a mass slaughter of other human being even to satisfy the base instinct of vengeance and retaliate to settle score over many decade we have see that these mass would always refuse to turn racist simply because they be subject to cruel racist rule when a hero in their midst chris hani be murder in cold blood they refuse to fulfil the prophesy of the poet that the blooddimmed tide would be loose to drown the ceremony of innocence they stood in the voting line side by side with those who have be their oppressor and never uttered a single word of anger nor jostled their white person next to them because they felt that their time to become the new master have come black and white stood together act voluntarily together for the first time in our history together to give birth to a new social order that would serve the interest of all our people when the leadership of these black mass say to them that despite the fact that their child their brother and sister their mother and father have be slaughter in boipatong and elsewhere on the many kill field in our country they a leader be oblige to pursue the peaceful advance to a just peace these mass agree and urge that the dialogue chamber should bring to the nation the gift of a just peace they thought and act a they do because they knew well than those who have be certify a learn that it be only a just peace that would end their despair and bring into their life the sense of hope that would make it possible for them to bear the pain of hunger until the day come when they would no longer go hungry it be for these reason that they have fought ready to sacrifice their life for the just peace and the sense of hope they saw a the necessary condition for their survival a human being those among u who be fond of threaten violence to promote their cause should learn to know this that the mass of our people be ready and willing to sacrifice once again to defend the peace and keep alive the sense of hope that enables them to behave in mysteriously miraculous way i must presume that many of u read the move article by rian malan publish last sunday he sayson this day 10 year ago i be hiding gold coin under floorboard and try to get my hand on a gun before the balloon go up a a white south african i be fully expect war a rightwing boer and bantustan chief conspire to annihilate nelson mandela people and the anc leader squabble with president fw de klerk over who deserve more credit for their share nobel peace prize in my view peace would never come there be too much history too much pain and anger ten day before the predict apocalypse there come a miraculous reprieve a reverent quiet settle upon the nation and the election pass off entirely peacefully i set out to discredit the outcome the peace be illusory i sneer anarchy be still come look at crime rape gun and mayhem decay city abandon factory incompetence and corruption everywhere when our new ruler dismiss such criticism a racist i say fine if thats the price one pay for speak the truth i will consider myself honour and continue hospital dont work anymore surly nurse drunken teacher a civil service where the phone just ringhe end his personal testimony with these wordsit be infinitely bad to receive than to give especially if one be arrogant and the gift be something big like mercy or forgiveness the gift of 1994 be so huge that i choked on it and couldnt say thank you but i be not too proud to say it now i have borrow these honest word from rian malan to tell the painful story that strangely but not surprisingly because of april 27 1994 our freedom day despair have change it domicile now because freedom for all our people have become the define feature of our reality those who have rejoice in the supremacy of their race open their door to despair those who have have despair impose upon them rejoice in the triumph of the angel of hope that brought a new life of a share neighbourhood to all our people no longer fracture by high fortify wall of hatred fear and mistrust but this too the transference of the burden of despair become part of the reality that the new democratic order have to address it become part of what have to be do to achieve what president mandela foretold when he spoke from this podium about the expansion of the frontier of human fulfilment and the continuous extension of the frontier of freedom almost ten year after it liberation from white minority rule our country still face many challenge many of our people be unemployed many of our people continue to live in poverty violence against the person in all it form continue to plague especially those section of our population that be poor and live in socially depressed community the burden of disease impact on our people include aid continue to be a matter of serious concern a do issue that relate to the fact that many of our people include the youth lack the education and skill that our economy and society need there be still many of our people who live in shack and others who have no access to clean water proper sanitation and electricity imbalance and inequality that impact on fellow citizen on the basis of race gender and geographic dispersal continue to persist in the 1994 state of the nation address to which we have refer president mandela say we have learnt the lesson that our blemish speak of what all humanity should not do the point we have sought to make in the last few minute in refer to the challenge we continue to face be that the blemish of which madiba spoke continue to disfigure our society we have not a yet eradicate the cruel legacy we inherit that he characterise a the blemish that all humanity should avoid however despite this reality the answer we have give and will continue to give to the question whether we have make progress with regard to the fundamental task of which nelson mandela spoke on the 24th of may 1994 be a resound yestogether with all other objective observer of social development we have always know that our country blemish produce by more than three century of colonialism and apartheid could not be remove in one decade nevertheless we have no hesitation in say that we have make great advance to ensure the expansion of the frontier of human fulfilment and the continuous extension of the frontier of the freedom of which nelson mandela spoke almost ten year ago the statistic and concrete information of which the honourable member the distinguish guest and our country be familiar tell the real story of what we have do and have to do to create the peoplecentred society that have be central to the work of both our first and second democratic government this real story be that before 1994estimates of the housing backlog range from 14 million to 3 million unit and people living in shack be between 5 million to 77 million60 of the population of south africa have no access to electricity16 million people have no access to clean water22 million people do not have access to adequate sanitationthere be 17 fragment department of education with a disproportionate allocation of resource to white schoolsthere be 70

additional people now have access to clean water63 of household now have access to sanitationthere have be a successful formation of an integrate education system even though there be a clear need for more resource allocation and capacity building in poor areasnutrition and early childhood intervention have be establish to improve well result for child from poor backgroundsby 2002 secondary school enrolment have reach 85 again the real story of our country tell u that 10 year agosouth africa be in it twentyfirst year of doubledigit inflationthe country have have three year of negative growth the economy and the wealth of the nation be shrinkingsouth africa have experienced more than a decade of decline growth per caput the average income of south african have be fall since the 1980s and the overall wealth of the country decline by nearly onethirdfrom 1985 to the middle of 1994 total net capital outflow from our country amount to almost r50 billion government have run up a budget deficit equal to 95 of the gdp include the debt of the socalled independent homelandsthe net open forward position of the south african reserve bank be 25 billion in deficitpublic sector debt be equal to 64 of the gdp it be this unhealthy economic situation that lead chris stals to make the observation to which we have refer a decade laterinflation be down to four percent if you use the cpix or less than one percent if you use the cpi indexthe country be experience the long period of consistent positive growth since the gdp be properly record in the 1940sthe net open forward position of the south african reserve bank rise to 47 billion in surplus by the end of last yearpublic sector debt have come down to less than 50 of gdp since 2001 we have engage our people in the various province in the process of izimbizo the 7th and late be kwazulunatal by this mean we have sought to deepen the interaction between the national government and the mass of our people the national minister provincial and local government have also carry out their own imbizo campaign for the same reason we have just present some of the statistic that tell part of the story of our progress during our first decade of freedom towards the creation of a peoplecentred society the imbizo process have give u an excellent opportunity to hear directly from the people what these figure mean to them it have be truly inspire to hear directly from the people a they express their concern communicate their aspiration and make suggestion of what need to be do to take u far forward to meet the need of the people these mass essentially but not exclusively the poor of our country invariably speak well of the improvement to the quality of their life that have occur during the last ten year they talk about the increase access to well housing water electricity road land school meal and social grant but these mass be equally insistent about the need for all of u to act together to address the outstanding challenge regularly they raise the issue of the need for job and the need to provide appropriate training especially for the youth to ensure that on complete their school year they be able to find employment like others of our rural community rural kwazulunatal call on the government to help with the provision of tractor and seed to assist the people to till the soil the people have not hesitate to make frank and critical assessment especially of the quality of service delivery in their locality a well a the performance of the municipal councillor they also boldly raise other question such a crime health matter and instance of perceive or actual corruption and malpractice on thursday last week we be at msinga in kwazulunatal one of the participant at the imbizo complain that though people have cellular phone in this rural and mountainous area they could not use them he explain that this be because the cellular phone company have not erect the necessary mast the staff of the president office immediately contact vodacom and inform them of the complaint make at the imbizo i be very pleased to say that two day ago one of the local leader at msinga call to say that the service provider have come to the area within hour to attend to the complaint in less than a week the people of msinga have be give the possibility to communicate among themselves and with the rest of the country and the world by telephone we held our last imbizo in kwazulunatal at gamalakhe near harding in the ugu district municipality at this imbizo a local resident drew our attention to instance of corruption in our prison he then give u detail of his experience of this corruption we have pass these detail to judge thabane jali who head the judicial commission investigate malpractice in our correctional system and who i understand be also present in the chamber again i be pleased to say that within day of receive this information judge jali have already instruct people assist him in kwazulunatal to meet the complainant and follow up on his allegation i mention these two instance because they demonstrate both the positive response by the public and private sector to the call we have make for all our people to work together in the spirit of letsema to tackle the common problem face our country and people and the fact that the government take the imbizo process very seriously and try at all time to respond to the issue raise by the people within the context of availability of resource again i mention this because some in our country for reason best know to themselves seem very keen to criticise the government response to the iimbizo on false ground this happen recently when illinformed allegation be make about commitment we make to the people of bekkersdal in gauteng i would like to take this opportunity to thank both vodacom and judge jali and express the hope that others will follow the excellent example they have set for all of u but perhaps more strike than everything we have say so far about the imbizo process have be the palpable sense of confidence among the people in a well future for their country and themselves this go together with the complete absence of any sense of distance or alienation from the government they elect these mass attend the iimbizo confident of their right to communicate directly with their government and certain that the process present them with a genuine opportunity to have their concern address i have listen to our people boldly express their view even in area that not so long ago be paralyse by the fear that to speak one mind be to invite death this have say to me that we have move forward most significantly towards the realisation of the objective present by president mandela when he commit u to the continuous extension of the frontier of freedom most of u present here will remember that not so long ago the government and the state be to the mass of our people public enemy no 1 then some thought that to advance the demand that the people shall govern be mere rhetoric of politician hungry for power institution that be the cause of our despair have today become repository of hope when we present the state of the nation address to our second democratic parliament on june 25 1999 we spoke of the enormity of the challenge we face to succeed in create the care society we have spoken of we say that for this reason this be not a task that can be carry out by the government alone the challenge of the reconstruction and development of our society into one which guarantee human dignity face the entirety of our people it be a national task that call for the mobilisation of the whole nation into united people action into a partnership with government for progressive change and a well life for all for a common effort to build a win nation the government therefore commits itself to work in a close partnership with all our people inspire by the call faranani to ensure that we draw on the energy and genius of the nation to give birth to something that will surely be new good and beautiful the mass of our people individual and institution among whom today we cite judge thabane jali and vodacom be respond magnificently to the call we repeat today and will repeat in future farananiin a few month time we will return to these chamber to inaugurate our third democratic parliament whoever will be president then will deliver yet another state of the nation address that will provide an opportunity to address the more detailed issue on the government programme a well a matter that will be cover in the budget speech and the medium term revenue and expenditure perspective that will support the government action a our country begin it second decade of democracy today we present the longerterm perspective for the continued transformation of our country that will and must be base on our country achievement during it first decade of liberation in this regard we would like to restate this matter unequivocally that the policy we require to translate what president mandela say in may 1994 be firmly in place accordingly we do not foresee that there will be any need for new and major policy initiative the task we will all face during the decade ahead will be to ensure the vigorous implementation of these policy to create the win peoplecentred society of which nelson mandela spoke if i may say this create that win nation must include greatly improve organisation management and performance by all the national team bafana bafana the springbok the protea and our athletics team the work we will do must move our country forward decisively towards the eradication of poverty and underdevelopment in our country we must achieve far and visible advance with regard to the improvement of the quality of life of all our people affect many critical area of social existence include health safety and security moral regeneration social cohesion opening the door of culture and education to all and sport and recreation we will have to score new victory in the struggle to create an egalitarian society successfully address the important challenge of persist racial and gender inequality the disempowerment of our youth and people with disability and proper care for child and the elderly we must ensure that our country and people be properly position within the global community of nation fully understand and respond to the diverse political economic social and technological challenge of the process of globalisation in this regard we will have to persist in the work we be do towards the regeneration of africa and the construction of a new and more equitable world order the advance we must record demand that we ensure that the public sector discharge it responsibility to our people a a critical player in the process of the growth reconstruction and development of our country in particular this will require that we far strengthen our system of local government and ensure that the system of traditional government play the role ascribed to it in our constitution and legislation we must achieve great progress with regard to the integration of our system of governance achieve seamless cooperation both within and among all sphere of government at the same time we must far consolidate the practice of create publicprivate partnership and building governmentcivil society cooperation to ensure that we utilise our collective capacity to give far impetus to the overall development and transformation of our country with regard to the public sector i would like to take this opportunity to salute and thank especially the cadre of public sector manager and leader that have emerge over the last decade many of whom be with u in this chamber the work they have do and be do have place them at the very forefront of the historic process that be give birth to a new society i have no hesitation in say that they stand tall even among their counterpart elsewhere in the world we will continue to rely on them to lead the state and parastatal machinery a we break new ground towards the creation of a peoplecentred society a we enter our second decade of liberation we must continue to build the sense of national unity united action and the new patriotism that have manifest themselves in our people response to the call faranani masakhane letsema and vukuzenzele work together in condition of entrench democracy respect for human right peace and stability we must continue to produce the good news that have make our country a place of hope even for other people in the rest of the world we already have the policy and programme that will enable u to translate all the strategic objective we have just spoken of into a material factor in achieve the goal of the expansion of the frontier of human fulfilment and the continuous extension of the frontier of the freedom of which nelson mandela spoke a decade ago we have already identify the challenge pose by the second economy which economy constitutes the structural manifestation of poverty underdevelopment and marginalisation in our country we must therefore move vigorously to implement all the programme on which we have agree to ensure that we extricate all our people from the social condition that spell loss of human dignity these include the urban renewal and rural development programme the expand public work programme the expansion of microcredit and small enterprise the provision of adult basic education and modern skill and the development of the social and economic infrastructure this will also help u enormously to achieve the goal of nonracism nonsexism balance urbanrural development and social cohesion at the same time we must continue to focus on the growth development and modernisation of the first economy to generate the resource without which it will not be possible to confront the challenge of the second economy this be go to require far and significant infrastructure investment skill development scientific and technological research development and expansion of the knowledge economy growth and modernisation of the manufacturing and service sector deeper penetration of the global market by our product increase our saving level black economic empowerment and the far expansion of small and medium enterprise we will have to focus on the implementation of the measure we have identify to ensure that we achieve well value for the money spent on social delivery among other thing our success with regard to both the first and second economy must create the condition for u to reduce the number of our people dependent on social grant this will increase the resource available for social expenditure focus on invest in our people far to empower them to become well activist for reconstruction and development away from trap large number within the paradigm of poverty alleviation we will also have to ensure that the institution and process we have establish and institute to give effect to the constitutional and practical requirement for cooperative governance function effectively we must also focus especially on raise skill level within the public sector and ensure it managerial and technological modernisation driven by a clear understand of the developmental task of our democratic state we must be impatient with those in the public service who see themselves a penpusher and guardian of rubber stamp thief intent on selfenrichment bureaucrat who think they have a right to ignore the vision of batho pele who come to work a late a possible work a little a possible and knock off a early a possible we have also establish institution and process to give effect to our share desire to mobilise all our people voluntarily to act together to achieve the task of reconstruction and development quite clearly the sustain call for all of u to respond to a new patriotism have struck a chord among all our people black and white with the exception of the most selfish and selfcentred among u needle to say the far translation of the vision of faranani into a powerful motive force for progressive change can only be achieve within the context of the democratic popular and open participation of all our people black and white in determine our share destiny in this regard i notice that the traditional doomsayers be back at their favourite sport of try to frighten u with scarecrow seemingly these have not achieve the maturity of a rian malan instead they be painting monstrous picture of impend violence during the forthcoming election and radical constitutional amendment after the election by the very people who draft this constitution the mass of our people sacrifice everything to achieve peace and democracy for all of u these mass will not allow that desperate politician do desperate thing to win or retain power for themselves we be all perfectly aware of the task of the african renaissance or should be together we have work very hard to ensure that we make the necessary progress with the challenge of the regeneration of our continent at the same time we will still have to contribute a much a we can to the common african effort to strengthen such institution a sadc the african union and nepad and help ensure that they discharge their responsibility effectively we must do this work driven

accomplishment of the task of ensure a well life for all we must make the observation that the government be perfectly conscious of the fact that there be many in our society who be unable to benefit directly from whatever our economy be able to offer obviously this include those on pension and the very young but it also include people who be unskilled and those with low level of education in general this reflect the structural fault in our economy and society a a result of which we have a dual economy and society the one be modern and relatively well developed the other be characterise by underdevelopment and an entrench crisis of poverty we have to respond to the need of the fellow south african trap in the latter society in a focus and dedicate manner to extricate them from their condition the expansion in social provision must reach this sector of our society to relieve the poverty and suffer afflict these mass of our people a we will indicate later other government intervention will also focus on this sector in a particular way critically some of these intervention must aim at ensure that a many a possible of those who fall within this category move out of the trap within which they be caught accordingly the government must act to ensure that we reduce the number of people dependant on social welfare increase the number that rely for their livelihood on normal participation in the economy this also especially relevant to the accomplishment of the goal of enhance the dignity of every south african we must also refer to the important matter of gender equality some progress be be make in government to address this issue and in the private sector and civil society the campaign on the right of woman have start at least to form part of the national discourse but society still lag far behind in term of actual implementation particularly in mainstreaming gender issue on development and povertyeradication within government we will continue to insist on the implementation of the national framework for woman empowerment and gender equality concretely we will soon introduce a system through which gender representation target and content of programme become part of the core performance criterion of every government institution and manager the effective delivery of the expand service to the people require that we improve the efficiency of the public service without an efficient and effective public service it will be impossible for u to register the advance that we be capable of again this will require that we make a number of determine intervention by the middle of this year the national and provincial government will complete the process of audit the public service personnel in these sphere of government and determine their personnel need in term of the task that confront government this will enable u to effect the necessary adjustment to ensure that the public service have the people with the right skill at the right place in the right number to overcome the problem that we have continued to experience in the distribution of social grant with an adverse impact on people in need we shall speed up the process to set up a national social security agency cognisant of the critical role of local government the central and provincial government will work together to extend assistance to this sphere of our system of governance in particular to improve it managerial technical and administrative capacity the government will create a public service echelon of multiskilled community development worker who will maintain direct contact with the people where these mass live we be determine to ensure that government go to the people so that we sharply improve the quality of the outcome of public expenditure intend to raise the standard of living of our people it be wrong that government should oblige the people to come to the government even in circumstance in which the people do not know what service the government offer and have no mean to pay for the transport to reach government office it will be particularly important that we attract the right people into this cadre of community development worker train them properly and supervise them effectively these development worker must truly be inspire by the letter and spirit of batho pele among other thing these worker will help to increase the effectiveness of our system of local government strengthen it awareness of and capacity to respond to the need of the people at the local level to ensure the proper execution of multisector project we will appoint dedicate project manager accountable to team of relevant official and the executive with the authority and responsibility to ensure implementation across department

available accord to citizen need rather than the silo of the state bureaucracy an electronic version of the multipurpose community centre a parliament and our people know for two year we have focus on particular rural and urban node in the context of the drive to assist the poorest in our country to achieve development and an improve standard of living to improve our work in this regard step will be take to ensure proper coordination cooperation and operational integration among the three sphere of government we will this year also finalise the proposal for harmonisation of system condition of service and norm between the public service in the national and provincial sphere on the one hand and the municipality on the other this year we also have to finalise the longrunning debate about the role and place of the institution of traditional leadership bearing in mind that this be one of our constitutional organ of government the necessary national framework legislation will therefore be table which will enable the provincial legislature to approve legislation specific to each of our province in cooperation with the provincial government a multidisciplinary national team be work in

require that we take new measure to increase the volume and quality of our investment in the social infrastructure this include such area a housing and municipal infrastructure hospital and clinic

obligation we will ensure that these resource be actually use consistent with what we have say about the need to ensure that we have the necessary mechanism to implement our policy and decision in this regard we must commend the province for significantly improve efficiency in the area of capital investment for the period of 9 month of the current fiscal year expenditure in this area have increase by 48 per cent compare to the same period during the previous fiscal year at the same time it seem clear that not all the allocate fund will be spent by the end of the financial year it be precisely this shortcoming that we must address this year with regard to this social investment we will pay particular but not exclusive attention to the nodal point already identify in the context of our urban renewal and rural development programme it be in these area that we find the large concentration of the marginalise section of our population which require dedicate intervention to extricate them from condition of underdevelopment and entrench poverty this dictate that we focus on them with regard to our social spending a well a social and economic infrastructure investment to address this investment in social infrastructure the government have decide that we should launch an expand public work programme this will ensure that we draw significant number of the unemployed into productive work and that these worker gain skill while they work and thus take an important step to get out of the pool of those who be marginalise we will also far expand the network of the multipurpose community centre the government will also make various intervention in the economy in general far to encourage it growth and development in this regard we must mention that it be plan that the growth and development summit that we mention last year be now schedule for the begin of may among others the summit should address issue of high rate of investment job creation economic restructuring and improve efficiency and productivity and great social equity all the social partner will have to indicate what they will contribute to the common effort to tackle these various

far work will also be do to improve the infrastructure at our major border post to facilitate movement of people and good necessarily this must be accompany by the appropriate staff of these transit point to eliminate inefficiency that derive from undertrained personnel far to reduce the cost of do business in our country with regard to liquid fuel the government have decide to replace the in bond land cost pricing mechanism with what be refer to a the basic fuel price formula this new approach which we believe will save fuel user more than r1 billion a year will be phase in start in april this year we wish to assure the industry that this process will be handle in a manner that do not adversely affect the sustainability of the industry and element of black economic empowerment already agree upon with regard to the restructuring of state asset the honourable member know that we will soon proceed with the listing of telkom work will also go ahead towards the introduction of a second national telecommunication operator we have already mention the initiative affect the transport sector far work will be do relate to electricity the government will also continue to work on publicprivate partnership to increase it capacity to respond to the need of our people 50 of these be already operational in such area a health education transport housing information technology tourism and government accommodation the development and support for small and medium business and the cooperative sector remains a priority for government accordingly more financial and other resource will be commit to the development of this sector of our economy this will also see increase support for business chamber and business development organisation and the expansion of the business mentorship programme womenowned business will receive additional support through the south african woman entrepreneur network sawen which be launch last year similarly we will continue to pay attention to the important area of agricultural development we will table legislation amend the small business act among other thing to establish a nationwide advocacy body to act a the voice of this sector and to ensure that support to smmes be available at the local level throughout the country with regard to the rural area this year we will complete the processing of the communal land bill not only to ensure certainty in the ownership of asset by family in rural area include woman but also to encourage smallscale and cooperative agricultural production and thus improve food security a the bill indicates this will be do in such a way that communal relation and element of culture consistent with democracy and human right be not undermined in this context certainly government have no intention to marginalise the traditional system of government the government recognises the importance of the microenterprise sector with regard to the task of poverty alleviation we have therefore establish an apex fund to provide microcredit to people at the grassroots level discussion with institution active in this field will be conclude soon so that the fund set aside reach the people in need a soon a possible despite continue improvement in the capacity of the economy to create new job the issue of unemployment remains one of our major challenge fundamentally the solution to this problem be dependant on our achieve the necessary rate of economic growth and development accordingly everything we have say about the economy also relates directly to the issue of job creation in this context we must raise the critically important matter of human resource development a the honourable member know we launch our human resource development strategy in june 2001 this strategy cover the entire spectrum from early childhood development primary and secondary education technical and vocational training through adult basic education to skill enhancement through the sector education and training authority onthejob training in the public work programme and specialise institution such a the project advanced institute for information and communication technology a we have already indicate by the middle of the year we should have an accurate picture of the skill profile and skill shortage in the public service progress be also be make in identify such shortage in the private sector we be do this work so that we be able to focus our human resource development strategy correctly despite the problem they have experienced the seta have already show what can be achieve by the end of last year over 23 000 learner have or be participate in training programme range from entry level programme to professional level and postprofessional training across the entire spectrum of occupation and sector to increase access to these programme by the unemployed the government will take the lead in bring more of these into it own training programme we trust that the private sector will also do the same a part of the common contribution to the objective of the growth and development summit a we have also indicate we will use the expand public work programme to provide onthejob training to the worker that will carry out this programme again this will concentrate on the section among our work people that be marginalise by virtue of low educational and skill level we be convince that sustain and correctly focus work in the area of human resource development together with the varied economic intervention we have mention will help the country in the effort to attend to the important challenge of unemployment in this regard the government will also present to our social partner a framework for an employment strategy to ensure that we create the best possible condition for a concert drive to reduce the level of unemployment a we approach the end of the first decade of our new democracy the need for an economic transformation that brings about effective and significant black economic empowerment becomes more press we believe that it be in the interest of all citizen that we succeed in this endeavour through a farsighted partnership between all sector of our society we can ensure a stable and grow economy that era the inequity of the past and draw u all irrespective of our race sex or creed into a more prosperous and equitable future the government concurs with the view of the black economic empowerment commission that it be now necessary to make our policy on black economic empowerment more explicit in the light of the important development in industry such a liquid fuel fishing and mining we need to ensure clarity and certainty for all economic actor the government be firmly of the view that economic growth development and black economic empowerment be complementary and related process the empowerment we speak of be an inclusive process and not an exclusive one no economy can meet it potential if any part of it citizen be not fully integrate into all aspect of that economy equally it follow that an economy that be not grow can not integrate all it citizen into that economy in a meaningful way the government have prepared a detailed set of proposal on black economic empowerment and the minister of trade and industry and the department of trade and industry on behalf of government have consult extensively today i will set out the basic framework and approach on budget day the minister of finance will deal with the government positive financial and macroeconomic assessment of the bee process and shortly thereafter the minister of trade and industry will publish the detailed document and process that i will now outline we will introduce into parliament early this year a basic enable piece of legislation that will establish broad parameter for the policy and allow for the publication of the strategy document and guideline deal with good practice in term of the policy all of which will make up the global transformation charter this approach have be adopt to allow pragmatism and flexibility within the different component of the economy a rigid and inflexible approach be not in the best interest of a modern and globally competitive economy however by passing such an enable act we wish to signal to all that meaningful economic transformation be fundamental to our collective prosperity a with all act the bill will be open to comment in the parliamentary process with the publication of the guideline shortly we intend to establish certainty and stability it be not in the interest of the economy that we have continuously move goal post however we also need to ensure that we respond effectively to change circumstance a we do with all policy and to this end we will establish a nonstatutory advisory council empowerment be define a a broadbased process and the scorecard approach cover ownership management employment equity skill development procurement corporate social responsibility investment and enterprise formation developed in the mining charter have be adopt the guideline will provide more precision a to what can be define a blackowned enterprise the action and outcome that be within bee policy will be spelt out government do not seek to encourage charter for every sector of the economy this be unrealistic and not necessarily useful the basic guideline be that where government disposes of any right licence or partnership arrangement then bee component to the arrangement will be clearly spelt out this be in line with exist practice a charter therefore best serf certain sector accordingly government be supportive of the work be do in the financial sector if enterprise in a sector feel that they need a charter they should be clear on their objective and take advice from government the guideline will set out the basic principle that should be contain in any charter and will make it clear that there need to be consultation at all time so a to involve stakeholder we would stress however that all enterprise will be encourage to utilise the guideline on empowerment and to develop their own scorecard approach certainly in any deal of significance with the public sector this will be expect of an enterprise the government will lay great stress on black economic empowerment that be associate with growth development and enterprise development and not merely redistribution of exist wealth we will work in partnership with the private sector and will far ensure that government action be coordinate and monitor madame speakerover the past three year our security agency have be hard at work implement the national crime combat strategy target at priority crime and police area with the high incidence of serious crime we can say with confidence that

we will do everything possible to get to the bottom of this matter be convince that no normal south african have any reason to resort to force to communicate his or her view the campaign to reduce the number of illegal firearm and other weapon will continue a considerable proportion of crime against the person include murder the abuse of woman and child assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and common assault take place among the most marginalize section of our population in many instance these be also connect to alcohol and drug abuse it be therefore necessary that we adopt a multisector approach to deal with these crime in the poor and underdeveloped area of our country measure will be take to ensure that the structure meant to support the security agency such a the sandf commando and police reservist be properly regulate to do what they be set up for in this regard in order to ensure security for all in the rural area include the farmer government will start in the

poverty will not succeed therefore a we outline our agenda for the year ahead our most immediate task be to dramatically reduce the severity of loadshedding in the come month and ultimately end loadshedding altogether under these condition we can not proceed a we usually would the people of south africa want action they want solution and they want government to work for them they simply want to know when a problem like loadshedding will be brought to an end we be therefore focus on those action that will make a meaningful difference now that will enable real progress within the next year and that will lay a foundation for a sustain recovery into the future we be not present new plan nor be we outline here the full programme of government rather we be concentrate on those issue that concern south african the most loadshedding unemployment poverty and the rise cost of living crime and corruption there be no easy solution to any of these challenge yet we have the strength the mean

for which they be design under it new board eskom be deploy people and resource to improve the reliability of the six power station that have contribute the most to loadshedding eskom be urgently

treasury be finalise a solution to eskoms r400 billion debt burden in a manner that be equitable and fair to all stakeholder which will enable the utility to make necessary investment in maintenance and transmission government will support eskom to secure additional funding to purchase diesel for the rest of the financial year this should reduce the severity of loadshedding a eskom will be able to use it dieselrun plant when the system be under strain eskom have launch a programme to buy excess power from private generator and have already secure 300 mw from our neighbour country the south african police service sap have establish a dedicate team with senior leadership to deal with the pervasive corruption and theft at several power station that have contribute to the poor performance

these measure will result in a massive increase in power to the grid over the next 12 to 18 month and beyond this power will be in line with our diverse mix of energy source include our current coalfired power station solar wind gas nuclear hydro and battery storage to fully implement this plan we need strong central coordination and decisive action in a time of crisis we need a single point of command and a single line of march just a we address the cause of the crisis we also need to address it impact the crisis have progressively evolve to affect every part of society we must act to

in the food production storage and retail supply chain include for the rollout of generator solar panel and uninterrupted power supply where technically possible it will enable u to exempt critical infrastructure such a hospital and water treatment plant from loadshedding and it will enable u to accelerate energy project and limit regulatory requirement while maintain rigorous environmental protection procurement principle and technical standard the auditorgeneral will be brought in to ensure continuous monitoring of expenditure in order to guard against any abuse of the fund need to
